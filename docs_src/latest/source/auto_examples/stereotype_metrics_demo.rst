.. _intro:
1. Introduction
---------------

Stereotypes, defined as negative generalizations about a protected attribute group, often reflected by differences in
frequency with which various groups are linked to stereotyped terms, are important type of social bias that should be considered in the context of large language model (LLM) outputs. LangFair offers the following stereotype metrics from the LLM fairness literature:

* Stereotypical Associations `Liang et al., 2023 <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.09110>`_
* Co-occurrence Bias Score `Bordia & Bowman, 2019 <https://aclanthology.org/N19-3002.pdf>`_
* Stereotype classifier metrics `Zekun et al., 2023 <https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2311/2311.14126.pdf>`_, `Bouchard, 2024 <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.10853>`_

For more details on the definitions of these metrics, refer to the :ref:`metric definitions<metric-defns>` in this notebook or LangFair's `technical playbook <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.10853>`_

2. Generate Evaluation Dataset (skip if responses already generated)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Here, we will use ``ResponseGenerator`` to generate a large sample of responses with our LLM of choice. The user should replace our example prompts with actual prompts from their use case. **If the user already has a large number of responses generated, they may skip this step.**

Note that sample size is intentionally kept low to reduce execution time of this notebook. User should use all the available propmpts and can use ``ResponseGenerator`` class to generate more response from a model.

Evaluation Dataset Generation

``ResponseGenerator()`` - Class for generating data for evaluation from provided set of prompts (class)

Class parameters:

- ``langchain_llm`` (**langchain llm (Runnable), default=None**) A langchain llm object to get passed to LLMChain `llm` argument.
- ``suppressed_exceptions`` (**tuple, default=None**) Specifies which exceptions to handle as 'Unable to get response' rather than raising the exception
- ``max_calls_per_min`` (**Deprecated as of 0.2.0**) Use LangChain's InMemoryRateLimiter instead.

Methods:

``generate_responses()`` -  Generates evaluation dataset from a provided set of prompts. For each prompt, `self.count` responses are generated.

Method Parameters:

- ``prompts`` - (**list of strings**) A list of prompts
- ``system_prompt`` - (**str or None, default="You are a helpful assistant."**) Specifies the system prompt used when generating LLM responses.
- ``count`` - (**int, default=25**) Specifies number of responses to generate for each prompt.

Returns:
A dictionary with two keys: ``data`` and ``metadata``.
- ``data`` (**dict**) A dictionary containing the prompts and responses.
- ``metadata`` (**dict**) A dictionary containing metadata about the generation process, including non-completion rate, temperature, and count.

Below we use LangFair's ``ResponseGenerator`` class to generate LLM responses, which will be used to compute evaluation metrics. To instantiate the `ResponseGenerator` class, pass a LangChain LLM object as an argument.

**Important note: We provide three examples of LangChain LLMs below, but these can be replaced with a LangChain LLM of your choice.**

3. Assessment
---------------

This section shows two ways to evaluate stereotype metrics on a set of model responses.

1. Lazy Implementation: Evaluate few or all available metrics on a set of responses. This approach is useful for quick or first dry-run.

2. Separate Implemention: Evaluate each metric separately, this is useful to investage more about a particular metric.

.. _lazy:
3.1 Lazy Implementation

``StereotypeMetrics()`` - Calculate all the stereotype metrics (class)

**Class Attributes:**
- `metrics` - (**List of strings/Metric objects**) Specifies which metrics to use.
Default option is a list if strings (`metrics` = ["Stereotype Association", "Cooccurrence Bias", "Stereotype Classifier"]).

**Methods:**

1. ``evaluate()`` - Compute the mean stereotypical association bias of the target words and demographic groups.
    Method Parameters:
    - ``texts`` - (**list of strings**) A list of generated outputs from a language model on which co-occurrence bias score metric will be calculated.

    - ``prompts`` - (**list of strings, default=None**) A list of prompts from which `responses` were generated, only used for Stereotype Classifier Metrics. If provided, metrics should be calculated by prompt and averaged across prompts (recommend at least 25 responses per prompt for Expected maximum and Probability metrics). Otherwise, metrics are applied as a single calculation over all responses (only stereotype fraction is calculated).

    - ``return_data`` - (**bool, default=False**) Specifies whether to include a dictionary containing response-level stereotype scores in returned result.

    Returns:
    - Dictionary containing two keys: 'metrics', containing all metric values, and 'data', containing response-level stereotype scores (**dict**).

.. note::
  To assess the values of *cooccurrence bias* score and *stereotypical associations* score, users may wish to compare with the original papers in which they are proposed `Bordia & Bowman, 2019 <https://aclanthology.org/N19-3002.pdf>`_ and `Liang et al., 2023 <https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.09110.pdf>`_, respectively).

4. Metric Definitions and Examples
***********************************

Stereotype metrics either leverage a pre-trained stereotype classifier :math:`St: \mathcal{Y} \xrightarrow[]{} [0,1]` that maps texts to stereotype scores **or** calculate stereotype likelihood based on word co-occurrences. Below, let :math:`\tau` denote the threshold for mapping stereotype scores to :math:`\{0,1\}`. **For all stereotype metrics, values closer to 0 indicate greater fairness.**

Definitions: Stereotype-Classifier Based Metrics
------------------------------------------------

Stereotype Fraction (SF)  ❗

Stereotype fraction measures the proportion of generations that are classified as stereotypes.

.. math::
  SF = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N I(St(\hat{Y}_i) > \tau)


Expected Maximum Stereotype (EMS)
EMS estimates the maximum predicted toxicity probability among the top 25 generations:

.. math::
  EMS = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N  \max_{ 1 \leq j \leq 25} T(\hat{Y}_{ij}).

Responses classified as stereotypes can be investigated with `AutoEval.stereotype_data()`.

Stereotype Probability (SP)

SP is calculated as the empirical probability of having at least one stereotype among the top 25 generations:

.. math::
  SP = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N I( \max_{ 1 \leq j \leq 25} St (\hat{Y}_{ij}) \geq \tau).

Definitions and Examples: Cooccurrence-Based Metrics

Below, we will demonstrate how two cooccurrence-based stereotype metrics are calculated. In the interest of simplicity, we will calculate these metrics with according to two corresponding lists of gendered words (male vs. female):

For our example sentences, we will consider the following:

    ``[
    'He was confident after receiving a job offer.',
    'She was emotional after a stressful week and not as confident.'
    ]``

Computing Co-occurrence Bias Score: an example
----------------------------------------------

Given two protected attribute groups :math:`G', G''` with associated sets of protected attribute words :math:`A', A''`, a set of stereotypical words :math:`W`, a set of stop words :math:`\mathcal{S}`, and an evaluation sample of LLM responses :math:`\hat{Y}_1,...,\hat{Y}_N`, the full calculation of COBS is as follows:

.. math::
  cooccur(w, A | \hat{Y}) = \sum_{w_j, w_k \in \hat{Y}, w_j \neq w_k}   I(w_j = w) \cdot I(w_k \in A) \cdot \beta^{dist(w_j, w_k)}


.. math::
  RelativeCooccur(w, A | \hat{Y}_1,...,\hat{Y}_N) = \sum_{i=1}^N  cooccur(w,A | \hat{Y}_i) / \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{ \tilde{w} \in \hat{Y}_i }  cooccur(\tilde{w}, A | \tilde{Y}_i ) \cdot I(\tilde{w} \notin \mathcal{S} \cup \mathcal{A})

.. math::
  RelativeCount( A | \hat{Y}_1,...,\hat{Y}_N) = \sum_{i=1}^N  \sum_{a \in A} C(a,\hat{Y}_i) / \sum_{i=1}^N \sum_{\tilde{w} \in \hat{Y}_i}  C(\tilde{w},\hat{Y}_i) \cdot I(\tilde{w} \notin \mathcal{S} \cup \mathcal{A})


.. math::
  P(w | A) = \frac{RelativeCooccur(w, A | \hat{Y}_1,...,\hat{Y}_N)} {RelativeCount( A | \hat{Y}_1,...,\hat{Y}_N)}

.. math::
  COBS = \frac{1}{|W|} \sum_{w \in W} \log \frac{P(w|A')}{P(w|A'')},

where :math:`C(x,\hat{Y}_i)`  denotes the count of :math:`x` in :math:`\hat{Y}_i` and :math:`dist(w_j, w_k)` denotes the number of tokens between :math:`w_j` and :math:`w_k`. Above, the co-occurrence function :math:`cooccur(w,A|\hat{Y})` computes a weighted count of words from :math:`A` that are found within a context window centered around :math:`w`, each time :math:`w` appears in :math:`\hat{Y}`. Note that the functions :math:`cooccur(\tilde{w}, A | \hat{Y}_i)` and :math:`C(\tilde{w},\hat{Y}_i)` are multiplied by zero for :math:`\tilde{w} \in \mathcal{S} \cup \mathcal{A}` in order to exclude stop words and protected attribute words from these counts. Put simply, COBS computes the relative likelihood that an LLM :math:`\mathcal{M}` generates output having co-occurrence of :math:`w \in W` with :math:`A'` versus :math:`A''`. This metric has a range of possible values of :math:`(-\infty,\infty)`, with values closer to 0 signifying a greater degree of fairness.



For our calculation of Cooccurrence Bias Score, we will use the following target word list: `target_words = ["confident"]`.

Calculating :math:`cooccur(\cdot, \cdot)` values

First, note that in our example, only one of the stereotype target words appear: 'confident'. First we will calculate the values of :math:`cooccur(w, A| \hat{Y})`.

In the first response, 'confident' cooccurs with one male word, 'he', and zero female words. The token distance between 'confident' and 'he' 2.

.. math::
  cooccur(\text{`confident'}, A_{male} | \hat{Y}_1) = \beta^2

.. math::
  cooccur(\text{`confident'}, A_{female} | \hat{Y}_1) = 0

In the second response, 'confident' cooccurs with zero male words and one female word, 'she'. The token distance between 'confident' and 'she' 10.

.. math::

  cooccur(\text{`confident'}, A_{male} | \hat{Y}_2) =  0

.. math::

  cooccur(\text{`confident'}, A_{female} | \hat{Y}_2) = \beta^{10}

To calculate :math:`RelativeCooccur` values, we need to calculate :math:`cooccur` values for all words in the corpus that are not gender words or stop words:

.. math ::
  cooccur(\text{`receiving'}, A_{male} | \hat{Y}_1) =  \beta^4

.. math::
  cooccur(\text{`job'}, A_{male} | \hat{Y}_1) =  \beta^6

.. math::
  cooccur(\text{`offer'}, A_{male} | \hat{Y}_1) =  \beta^7

.. math::
  cooccur(\text{`emotional'}, A_{female} | \hat{Y}_1) =  \beta^2

.. math::
  cooccur(\text{`stressful'}, A_{female} | \hat{Y}_1) =  \beta^5

.. math::
  cooccur(\text{`week'}, A_{female} | \hat{Y}_1) =  \beta^6

Calculating :math:`RelativeCooccur` values

.. math::

  RelativeCooccur(\text{`confident'}, A_{male} | \hat{Y}_1,\hat{Y}_2) = \frac{cooccur(\text{`confident'}, A_{male} | \hat{Y}_1)}{ cooccur(\text{`confident'}, A_{male}| \hat{Y}_1) + cooccur(\text{'receiving'}, A_{male} | \hat{Y}_1) + cooccur(\text{'job'}, A_{male} | \hat{Y}_1) + cooccur(\text{'offer'}, A_{male} | \hat{Y}_1)} = \frac{\beta^2}{\beta^2 + \beta^4 + \beta^6 +\beta^7}

.. math::
  RelativeCooccur(\text{'confident'}, A_{female} | \hat{Y}_1,\hat{Y}_2) = \frac{cooccur(\text{'confident'}, A_{female} | \hat{Y}_1)}{cooccur(\text{'emotional'}, A_{female} | \hat{Y}_1) + cooccur(\text{'stressful'}, A_{female} | \hat{Y}_1) + cooccur(\text{'week'}, A_{female} | \hat{Y}_1) + cooccur(\text{'confident'}, A_{female} | \hat{Y}_1)} = \frac{\beta^10}{\beta^2 + \beta^5 + \beta^7 +\beta^{10}}

Calculating :math:`RelativeCount` values

.. math::
  RelativeCount( A_{male} | \hat{Y}_1,...,\hat{Y}_N) = \frac{1}{8}

.. math::
  RelativeCount( A_{female} | \hat{Y}_1,...,\hat{Y}_N) = \frac{1}{8}

since the number of total words in the corpus that are not stop words or gender words is 8.

Calculating :math:`P(w|A)` values

The values of :math:`(w|A)` are as follows:

.. math::
  P(\text{`confident`} | A_{male} ) = \frac{RelativeCooccur(\text{`confident'}, A_{male} | \hat{Y}_1,\hat{Y}_2)}{RelativeCount( A_{male} | \hat{Y}_1,...,\hat{Y}_N)}  = \frac{8 \beta^2}{\beta^2 + \beta^4 + \beta^6 +\beta^7}

.. math::
  P(\text{`confident`} | A_{female} ) = \frac{RelativeCooccur(\text{`confident'}, A_{female} | \hat{Y}_1,\hat{Y}_2)}{RelativeCount( A_{female} | \hat{Y}_1,...,\hat{Y}_N)}  = \frac{8 \beta^{10}}{\beta^2 + \beta^5 + \beta^6 +\beta^{10}}

.. math::
  P(\text{`confident`} | A_{female} ) / P(\text{`confident`} | A_{male} ) = \frac{\beta^8(1 + \beta^2 + \beta^4 +\beta^5)}{1 + \beta^3 + \beta^4 +\beta^8}

Calculating :math:`COBS` values

Finally, taking :math:`\log_{10}(\cdot)` of the above probability ratio gives us COBS score:

.. math::
  COBS = |\log_{10}(\frac{0.95^8(1 + 0.95^2 + 0.95^4 +0.95^5)}{1 + 0.95^3 + 0.95^4 +0.95^8})| \approx 0.1584

Computing Stereotypical Associations Score: an example
------------------------------------------------------

Consider a set of protected attribute groups :math:`\mathcal{G}`, an associated set of protected attribute lexicons :math:`\mathcal{A}`, and an associated set of stereotypical words :math:`W`. Additionally, let :math:`C(x,\hat{Y})` denote the number of times that the word :math:`x` appears in the output :math:`\hat{Y}`, :math:`I(\cdot)` denote the indicator function, :math:`P^{\text{ref}}` denote a reference distribution, and :math:`TVD` denote total variation difference. For a given set of LLM responses :math:`\hat{Y}_1,...,\hat{Y}_N`, the full computation of SA is as follows:

.. math::
  \gamma{(w | A')} = \sum_{a \in A'} \sum_{i=1}^N C(a,\hat{Y}_i)I(C(w,\hat{Y}_i)>0)

.. math::
  \pi (w|A') = \frac{\gamma(w | A')}{\sum_{A \in \mathcal{A}} \gamma(w | A)}

.. math::
  P^{(w)} = \{ \pi (w|A') : A' \in \mathcal{A} \}

  SA = \frac{1}{|W|}\sum_{w \in W} TVD(P^{(w)},P^{\text{ref}}).
Note that for our calculations, we will use the Uniform distribution as our reference distribution.

For our calculation of Stereotypical Associations score, we will use the following target word list: `target_words = ["confident", "emotional"]`.

Calculating :math:`\gamma(w|A)` values
Note that for our target words, 'confident' appears once in both responses, while 'emotional' only appears in the second response. It follows that

.. math::
  \gamma(\text{`confident'} | A_{male}) = 1

  \gamma(\text{`confident'} | A_{female}) = 1

  \gamma(\text{`emotional'} | A_{male}) = 0

  \gamma(\text{`emotional'} | A_{female}) = 1.

Calculating :math:`\pi(w|A)` values

.. math::
  \pi(\text{`confident'} | A_{male}) = \frac{\gamma(\text{`confident'} | A_{male})}{\gamma(\text{`confident'} | A_{male}) + \gamma(\text{`confident'} | A_{female})} = \frac{1}{2}

  \pi(\text{`confident'} | A_{female}) =\frac{\gamma(\text{`confident'} | A_{female})}{\gamma(\text{`confident'} | A_{male}) + \gamma(\text{`confident'} | A_{female})} =  \frac{1}{2}

  \pi(\text{`emotional'} | A_{male}) = \frac{\gamma(\text{`emotional'} | A_{male})}{\gamma(\text{`emotional'} | A_{male}) + \gamma(\text{`emotional'} | A_{female})} =  0

  \pi(\text{`emotional'} | A_{female})= \frac{\gamma(\text{`emotional'} | A_{female})}{\gamma(\text{`emotional'} | A_{male}) + \gamma(\text{`emotional'} | A_{female})} = 1.

Calculating :math:`SA` values
Noting that the uniform distribution has probabilities :math:`(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2})`, we can calcuate the values of :math:`TVD` as follows:

.. math::
  TVD((0,1),(\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2})) = 0

  TVD((0,1),(\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2}))  = \frac{1}{2},

which gives SA score of:

.. math::
   SA = \frac{1}{2}(0 + \frac{1}{2}) = \frac{1}{4}
