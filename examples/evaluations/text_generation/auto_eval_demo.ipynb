Why are you here today?\\\\n#Person2#: I found it would be a good idea to get a check-up.\\\\n#Person1#: Yes, well, you haven't had one for 5 years. You should have one every year.\\\\n#Person2#: I know. I figure as long as there is nothing wrong, why go see the doctor?\\\\n#Person1#: Well, the best way to avoid serious illnesses is to find out about them early. So try to come at least once a year for your own good.\\\\n#Person2#: Ok.\\\\n#Person1#: Let me see here. Your eyes and ears look fine. Take a deep breath, please. Do you smoke, Mr. Smith?\\\\n#Person2#: Yes.\\\\n#Person1#: Smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer and heart disease, you know. You really should quit.\\\\n#Person2#: I've tried hundreds of times, but I just can't seem to kick the habit.\\\\n#Person1#: Well, we have classes and some medications that might help. I'll give you more information before you leave.\\\\n#Person2#: Ok, thanks doctor.\\n\",\n",

Let's see, according to his vaccination record, Ricky has received his Polio, Tetanus and Hepatitis B shots. He is 14 months old, so he is due for Hepatitis A, Chickenpox and Measles shots.\\\\n#Person2#: What about Rubella and Mumps?\\\\n#Person1#: Well, I can only give him these for now, and after a couple of weeks I can administer the rest.\\\\n#Person2#: OK, great. Doctor, I think I also may need a Tetanus booster. Last time I got it was maybe fifteen years ago!\\\\n#Person1#: We will check our records and I'll have the nurse administer and the booster as well. Now, please hold Ricky's arm tight, this may sting a little.\\n\",\n",

I'd like to help you look for the missing keys.\\\\n#Person1#: It's very kind of you.\\\\n#Person2#: It's not a big deal.Hey, I found them.\\\\n#Person1#: Oh, thank God! I don't know how to thank you, guys.\\\\n#Person2#: You're welcome.\\n\",\n",

I'll show you all the right moves. My name's Malik.\\\\n#Person2#: Nice to meet you. I'm Wen, and this is Nikki.\\\\n#Person1#: How you feeling', vista?
