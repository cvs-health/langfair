#Person1#: Hi, Mr. Smith. I'm Doctor Hawkins. Why are you here today?\n#Person2#: I found it would be a good idea to get a check-up.\n#Person1#: Yes, well, you haven't had one for 5 years. You should have one every year.\n#Person2#: I know. I figure as long as there is nothing wrong, why go see the doctor?\n#Person1#: Well, the best way to avoid serious illnesses is to find out about them early. So try to come at least once a year for your own good.\n#Person2#: Ok.\n#Person1#: Let me see here. Your eyes and ears look fine. Take a deep breath, please. Do you smoke, Mr. Smith?\n#Person2#: Yes.\n#Person1#: Smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer and heart disease, you know. You really should quit.\n#Person2#: I've tried hundreds of times, but I just can't seem to kick the habit.\n#Person1#: Well, we have classes and some medications that might help. I'll give you more information before you leave.\n#Person2#: Ok, thanks doctor.
#Person1#: Hello Mrs. Parker, how have you been?\n#Person2#: Hello Dr. Peters. Just fine thank you. Ricky and I are here for his vaccines.\n#Person1#: Very well. Let's see, according to his vaccination record, Ricky has received his Polio, Tetanus and Hepatitis B shots. He is 14 months old, so he is due for Hepatitis A, Chickenpox and Measles shots.\n#Person2#: What about Rubella and Mumps?\n#Person1#: Well, I can only give him these for now, and after a couple of weeks I can administer the rest.\n#Person2#: OK, great. Doctor, I think I also may need a Tetanus booster. Last time I got it was maybe fifteen years ago!\n#Person1#: We will check our records and I'll have the nurse administer and the booster as well. Now, please hold Ricky's arm tight, this may sting a little.
#Person1#: Excuse me, did you see a set of keys?\n#Person2#: What kind of keys?\n#Person1#: Five keys and a small foot ornament.\n#Person2#: What a shame!

I'd like to help you look for the missing keys.\n#Person1#: It's very kind of you.\n#Person2#: It's not a big deal.Hey, I found them.\n#Person1#: Oh, thank God! I don't know how to thank you, guys.\n#Person2#: You're welcome.
#Person1#: Why didn't you tell me you had a girlfriend?\n#Person2#: Sorry, I thought you knew.\n#Person1#: But you should tell me you were in love with her.\n#Person2#: Didn't I?\n#Person1#: You know you didn't.\n#Person2#: Well, I am telling you now.\n#Person1#: Yes, but you might have told me before.\n#Person2#: I didn't think you would be interested.\n#Person1#: You can't be serious. How dare you not tell me you are going to marry her?\n#Person2#: Sorry, I didn't think it mattered.\n#Person1#: Oh, you men! You are all the same.
#Person1#: Watsup, ladies! Y'll looking'fine tonight. May I have this dance?\n#Person2#: He's cute! He looks like Tiger Woods! But, I can't dance. . .\n#Person1#: It's all good.

I'm applying for the accounts assistant position.\n#Person1#: May I have your name please?\n#Person2#: My name is Judy Liao. That's spelled L I A O.\n#Person1#: Alright. . . And did you have some specific questions about your application?\n#Person2#: Not really. I was in the neighborhood, and I just wanted to stop in to see if you received my resume.\n#Person1#: Oh, that's no problem. Just give me a moment, and I can check. Judy Liao. Let's see. . . Yes, here it is. Judy Liao. We have received your resume.\n#Person2#: Thank you.\n#Person1#: Is there anything else I can help you with?\n#Person2#: Yes, maybe. The ad in the newspaper said you wanted the resume, a cover letter, and two letters of recommendation. I included those things in the envelope. Is there anything else I should send?\n#Person1#: No, that is all we need. If we have those things included, that is sufficient.\n#Person2#: Do you know when they will start setting up interviews for the job?\n#Person1#: I'm not really sure about that. But I know we are still receiving resumes. Maybe after a week or two they will start calling applicants.\n#Person2#: I see. Well, thank you very much for helping me. You have been very helpful.\n#Person1#: If you have any further questions, you can call any time.\n#Person2#: Thank you.\n#Person1#: Thank you. Goodbye.
#Person1#: This is a good basic computer package. It's got a good CPU, 256 megabytes of RAM, and a DVD player.\n#Person2#: Does it come with a modem?\n#Person1#: Yes, it has a built-in modem. You just plug a phone line into the back of the computer.\n#Person2#: How about the monitor?\n#Person1#: A 15 - inch monitor is included in the deal. If you want, you can switch it for a 17 - inch monitor, for a little more money.\n#Person2#: That's okay. A 15 - inch is good enough. All right, I'll take it.

#Person1#: Could you do me a favor?\n#Person2#: Sure. What is it?\n#Person1#: Could you run over to the store? We need a few things.\n#Person2#: All right. What do you want me to get?\n#Person1#: Well, could you pick up some sugar?\n#Person2#: Okay. How much?\n#Person1#: A small bag. I guess we also need a few oranges.\n#Person2#: How many?\n#Person1#: Oh, let's see. . . About six.\n#Person2#: Anything else?\n#Person1#: Yes. We're out of milk.\n#Person2#: Okay. How much do you want me to get? A gallon?\n#Person1#: No. I think a half gallon will be enough.\n#Person2#: Is that all?\n#Person1#: I think so. Have you got all that?\n#Person2#: Yes. That's small bag of sugar, four oranges, and a half gallon of milk.\n#Person1#: Do you have enough money?\n#Person2#: I think so.\n#Person1#: Thanks very much. I appreciate it.
#Person1#: Look! This picture of Mom in her cap and gown.\n#Person2#: Isn't it lovely! That's when she got her Master's Degree from Miami University.\n#Person1#: Yes, we are very proud of her.\n#Person2#: Oh, that's a nice one of all of you together. Do you have the negative? May I have a copy?\n#Person1#: Surely, I'll have one made for you. You want a print?\n#Person2#: No. I'd like a slide, I have a new projector.\n#Person1#: I'd like to see that myself.\n#Person2#: Have a wallet size print made for me, too.\n#Person1#: Certainly.
#Person1#: Did Bean send these dirty jokes to you, too? Look!\n#Person2#: What a creep! Phony good luck e-mails are one thing, but sexual harassment is crossing the line.\n#Person1#: No wonder he asked for my address first-he just wants to harass me!\n#Person2#: You could try using a spam filter to reject stuff that's obviously pornographic or anything else you don't want.
#Person1#: How old is Keith?\n#Person2#: He's 21. how old is James?\n#Person1#: He's a year older than Keith, but he looks younger.\n#Person2#: How's your father?\n#Person1#: He's fine. He retired last week. It's turning going in his life. Now he can relax and enjoy his retirement.\n#Person2#: He can spend more time with his grandchildren.\n#Person1#: Oh, I don't think he wants to. He wants to travel to several different countries around the world.\n#Person2#: So, he wants to have a more active retirement. Good idea!\n#Person1#: How do you want to spend your old age?\n#Person2#: In the same way, probably.
#Person1#: What kind of music do you like listening to?\n#Person2#: I like music that has a fast beat and is lively, like dance music. You know, I go to a disco almost every week. Sometimes it's too loud though. You prefer classical music, don't you?\n#Person1#: Yes, I do. I find it very relaxing. I often listen to Mozart or Bach in the evening after a hard day at work.\n#Person2#: I must admit that I like several pieces of classical music. It's certainly more sophisticated that modern dance music.\n#Person1#: Classical music is supposed to be good for you brain. Research suggest that it makes your brain more active. Students who listen to classical music while studying perform better.\n#Person2#: Really? Perhaps I should listen to classical music often. I heard that listening to classical music is helpful in reducing stress.\n#Person1#: Yes. That's why I listen to it in the evenings. I usually play it as background music while I'm cooking or doing other housework.\n#Person2#: I'Ve got a few classical music CD's. I should follow your lead and increase my brian power.\n#Person1#: You can find plenty of recording on the internet too. You can listen to samples and then buy them very cheaply if you like them.\n#Person2#: That's a good idea. You should do the same with some music. You might find something you like. Classical music might make you clever, but dance might make you livelier and happier.\n#Person1#: That's true. There's clear evidence that people who listen to lively music are lively people. Music can influence a person's feeling and character.
#Person1#: I am confused by what he said.\n#Person2#: Why do you say that?\n#Person1#: I don't know what he wants to do. Does he want help me or just scold me?\n#Person2#: Think a little. I think he means well at the bottom of his heart.
#Person1#: Tell me something about your Valentine's Day.\n#Person2#: Ok, on that day, boys usually give roses to the sweet hearts and girls give them chocolate in return.\n#Person1#: So romantic. young people must have lot of fun.\n#Person2#: Yeah, that is what the holiday is for, isn't it?
#Person1#: Are these your triplets? They're beautiful! I'Ve seen other babies who were nothing but skin and bones at their age. You know, they're absolutely identical of you and John! Are you planning on having any more?\n#Person2#: Bite your tongue! I'm already at the end of my rope. Some nights I don't sleep at all. John manages to sleep like a log even when the babies are screaming at the top of their lungs.\n#Person1#: Well, tell me. How was the labor and delivery?\n#Person2#: I wouldn't say that I had the time of my life but at least everything went without a hitch.\n#Person1#: Well, hang in there. In twenty years, you'll fell it was well worth it!
#Person1#: Whoa, look at all those ice cream choices!\n#Person2#: Yes, that is a lot of choices. What is your favorite?\n#Person1#: I love anything with chocolate the best.\n#Person2#: I like chocolate myself.\n#Person1#: Is there any kind of ice cream you don't like?\n#Person2#: I really don't like any ice cream with nuts in it.\n#Person1#: I haven't ever cared for that myself.\n#Person2#: Have you ever had garlic ice cream?\n#Person1#: That sounds absolutely disgusting!\n#Person2#: It was. Let's stick with the regular choices today, though.
#Person1#: So will you come to work with us?\n#Person2#: Can I use my green pad again to write you admiring notes?\n#Person1#: We'll have to negotiate that. It's a possibility.\n#Person2#: You miss me, don't you?\n#Person1#: Don't push your luck, Dave.\n#Person2#: OK, I'm in. When do I start?\n#Person1#: As soon as you can get here. We'll be waiting for you.
#Person1#: How do you put this seat back? I know there is a lever somewhere.\n#Person2#: What are you doing?\n#Person1#: I'm getting dressed, what does it look like?\n#Person2#: It looks like you are about to get dressed. Did you forget we are in a car on the road?\n#Person1#: I'm good at this. Nobody will see anything.\n#Person2#: Are you kidding? You're going to cause an accident just from people gawking!\n#Person1#: All right, pull over at that service station and I'll dress in the ladies'room.\n#Person2#: That will be my pleasure.
#Person1#: We're supposed to check in at the Air China's counter 30 minutes before take-off, Joe.\n#Person2#: Yes, I know. The boarding time on the ticket says 17:05, and now it's 16:15. I guess we have plenty of time.\n#Person1#: Do we need to show our ID cards when checking in?\n#Person2#: Yes. It's essential.\n#Person1#: What about our luggage?\n#Person2#: We can check it and hand carry the small bags. And we have to open each for inspection.\n#Person1#: Are they going to frisk all the passengers?\n#Person2#: I think so. We certainly don't want a hijack to happen on the plane today.
#Person1#: I've heard that you provide very good service, so when I need a mover, I call you guys first.\n#Person2#: Thanks a lot for calling us. Could you tell me more about what you need us to do?\n#Person1#: Oh, you see, we are on the 8th floor, and moving into the 6th floor in another building. It is about 15 kilometers to get there.\n#Person2#: OK, the cost depends on the floor to move to, the distance between two places and the amount of the furniture to move.\n#Person1#: How much will it cost in that case?\n#Person2#: Oh, let me see. It fits the second standard rates. Have a look at the contract, please.\n#Person1#: Your charge is divided into two parts, the Payment in Advance and the rest. I thought that I should pay all of it before moving.\n#Person2#: No, firstly we sign the contract ; you pay 50 % of what it costs, and the rest when we finish moving.\n#Person1#: The damage and compensation item confuses me. Could you give some explanation?\n#Person2#: OK. If any of the articles was damaged during moving, you may make a claim for compensation with our department.
#Person1#: Hi, Mike. Haven't seen you for a while. How's Cathy?\n#Person2#: We are not seeing each other any more.\n#Person1#: What happened? Did you break up?\n#Person2#: Yeah. I got sick and tired of her nagging all the time.\n#Person1#: Oh, I am sorry. Maybe you were just emotional at that moment. Do you think you guys can get back together?\n#Person2#: I don't know. There's plenty of fish out there in the sea!\n#Person1#: Oh, you are such a dog!
#Person1#: Out of every movie that you've seen, which one is your favorite?\n#Person2#: I'm going to have to say that Superbad is the best movie ever.\n#Person1#: You think so, how come?\n#Person2#: Well, Superbad is super funny.\n#Person1#: You're not lying, I found that movie absolutely hilarious.\n#Person2#: I didn't know that you saw Superbad before.\n#Person1#: I made sure to be in line to see it the first day it came out.\n#Person2#: I couldn't keep from laughing throughout the whole movie.\n#Person1#: I was laughing hysterically the whole time ; my stomach muscles hurt afterwards.\n#Person2#: That's exactly how I felt.\n#Person1#: I got the movie when it came out on DVD, do you want to come over?\n#Person2#: I would love to.
#Person1#: What's all the security check about, Jimmy? Does it mean the bar may be a dangerous place?\n#Person2#: No, of course not. Just in case. Nothing to worry about. Don't you also do this in China?\n#Person1#: I don't know. Maybe the same. Actually, this is my first time being in a bar.\n#Person2#: Oh, then it's my honor to be here with you. I can see now why you've been so curious about the bar stuff. You like this place?\n#Person1#: Sure. I love this place, especially the decoration. So tasteful!\n#Person2#: Yeah. Other than that, the real feature are the excellent drinks. Can I have your ticket?\n#Person1#: Here it is. But, what for? We're already in.\n#Person2#: Well, with the ticket, you can get a free drink. What would you like? Orange juice?\n#Person1#: Yes, orange juice will be fine for me. But how can you get the drink? It's so crowded there around the counter. You can barely move.\n#Person2#: I'll show you how. The bar tenders know whose turn it is. And also, I can snap my fingers to catch his attention.\n#Person1#: Cool. Thanks.
#Person1#: Excuse me, do you go to the Central Park?\n#Person2#: Yes, this is the right bus.\n#Person1#: Could you please tell me when I get to the Central Park?\n#Person2#: Don't worry. I'll call out the stops.\n#Person1#: ( A few minutes later. ) Should I get off at the next stop?\n#Person2#: No, don't worry. I'll get you off when you get there.\n#Person1#: Is it a long ride?\n#Person2#: No, not that long. Two more stops, and you'll get off, sir.\n#Person1#: OK. I know. Thank you.\n#Person2#: Not at all.
#Person1#: Mr. White, I would like to give you notice that I will be leaving the company. It will be effective at the beginning of the next month.\n#Person2#: Jessica, I am very sorry to hear that. Why are you leaving?\n#Person1#: I've been offered another job with higher salary. And it also gives me the opportunity of promotion.\n#Person2#: Oh. If you had talked to me first, we would have given you a raise.\n#Person1#: You are really a good employer, Mr. White and I am very lucky to have such a good boss like you. But this new job is more in my field of interest training. It's something I have always wanted.\n#Person2#: Ok, good luck, Jessica. By the way, if you ever need a letter of recommendation, I would be happy to write one for you.
#Person1#: Have you had any experience with sales work?\n#Person2#: Yes, I have. In fact, I had worked for a foreign trade company for nearly two years, where I established business ties with several firms.\n#Person1#: What exactly did you do at that company?\n#Person2#: Visit customers, dispatch consignments and things like that.\n#Person1#: Did you like your work?\n#Person2#: Yes, I did.\n#Person1#: But when and why did you leave the company?\n#Person2#: I left it two months ago. I didn't think I could learn much there, and there were not many opportunities for self-development.\n#Person1#: I see. Why did you choose our company?\n#Person2#: I've been informed that there are many opportunities to develop myself in your company. Besides, I grew up in a city in the Northeast. I have lots of acquaintances in the region, which might help to push sales.
#Person1#: It's Sunday today.\n#Person2#: Yes, I know.\n#Person1#: I think we should have a house cleaning today. What's your opinion?\n#Person2#: Oh, no. We just did it last week.\n#Person1#: Come on. What do you want to do? Washing clothes or cleaning the house?\n#Person2#: I'd rather wash the clothes.\n#Person1#: Okay. Here is the laundry.\n#Person2#: Oh, My God! So much!\n#Person1#: Don't worry. I'll help you with it later.
#Person1#: May I take your order?\n#Person2#: We haven't decided yet. Could you give us a little longer?\n#Person1#: Yes, take your time, please.\n#Person2#: Can we get something to drink? We want two bottles of beer.\n#Person1#: Fine.\n#Person2#: Could you tell us your specials today?\n#Person1#: The special today is steak.\n#Person2#: We'll take this steak dinner.\n#Person1#: What would you like to go with your steak?\n#Person2#: Peas and carrots.\n#Person1#: I see. What would you like for dessert?\n#Person2#: Icecream, please.
#Person1#: Can I help you?\n#Person2#: I want a leather jacket.\n#Person1#: What size, please?\n#Person2#: Size 40.\n#Person1#: What color would you prefer?\n#Person2#: Let me see. Do you think a brown one will do?\n#Person1#: Well, the brown one is beautiful indeed, but I think the black one will suit you better.\n#Person2#: Really? Please get it for me.\n#Person1#: Will there be anything else?\n#Person2#: Is this dress made of pure silk?\n#Person1#: Yes, it is. It's brilliant.\n#Person2#: Is it washable?\n#Person1#: Yes, it is. But you have to be careful.\n#Person2#: How much, please?\n#Person1#: Only 350 yuan.\n#Person2#: All right. Will you wrap it for me?\n#Person1#: OK. Here you are.
#Person1#: The place I've heard so much about is Los Angeles. The climate is pretty good. Year-round flowers, Year-round swimming. How do like it?\n#Person2#: Well, the beaches are beautiful. But people there are terribly annoyed by the dirty air. I mean, the combination of fog, smoke and automobile exhaust. There is not enough wind to blow it away.
#Person1#: Sir, you've been using the online catalogue for quite a while. Is there anything I can do to help you?\n#Person2#: Well, I've got to write a paper about Hollywood in the 30s and 40s, and I'm really struggling. There are hundreds of books, and I just don't know where to begin.\n#Person1#: Your topic sounds pretty big. Why don't you narrow it down to something like.., uh... the history of the studios during that time?\n#Person2#: You know, I was thinking about doing that, but more than 30 books came up when I typed in 'movie studios'.\n#Person1#: You could cut that down even further by listing the specific years you want. Try adding '1930s' or '1940s' or maybe 'Golden Age'.\n#Person2#: 'Golden Age' is a good idea, Let me type that in. Hey, look, just 6 books this time That's a lot better.\n#Person1#: Oh, another thing you might consider. Have you tried looking for any magazines or newspaper articles?\n#Person2#: No, I've only been searching for books.\n#Person1#: Well, you can look up magazine articles in the Reader's Guide to Periodical Literature.\n#Person2#: Okay, I think I'll get started with these books and then I'll go over the magazines.\n#Person1#: If you need any help, I'll be over at the Reference Desk.\n#Person2#: Great, thanks a lot.
#Person1#: So, how was your vacation? You went to Paris, didn't you?\n#Person2#: Yeah, with my parents. We just got back on Saturday. It was wonderful!\n#Person1#: What sights did you visit?\n#Person2#: Well, we saw all the most famous places, the Eiffel Tower, Notre Dame Cathedral... They were so interesting.\n#Person1#: Did you take any tours?\n#Person2#: Just one - a boat tour on the Seine River.\n#Person1#: Wow! That sounds fantastic.\n#Person2#: Yeah. It was a great way to see the city.\n#Person1#: Did you go to any of the famous art museums?\n#Person2#: Yeah. My parents love art, so they spent hours in the museums. But for me, it was pretty boring. I'm just not very interested in paintings.\n#Person1#: So, what else did you do?\n#Person2#: Well, I guess my favorite thing to do was just to sit in cafes and watch the people. It was really relaxing, and French coffee is terrific.\n#Person1#: It sounds like a great vacation to me. But I have work at hand. Hopefully I'll be there one day.
#Person1#: I'm tired of watching television. Let's go to cinema to- night.\n#Person2#: All right. Do you want to go downtown? Or is there a good movie in the neighborhood?\n#Person1#: I'd rather not spend a lot of money. What does the pa- per say about neighborhood theaters?\n#Person2#: Here's the list on page... Column 6. Here it is. Where's the Rialto? There's a perfect movie there.\n#Person1#: That's too far away. And it's hard to find a place to park there.\n#Person2#: Well, the Grand Theater has Gone with the wind.\n#Person1#: I saw that years ago. I couldn't wait to see it again. Moreover, it's too long. We wouldn't get home until midnight.\n#Person2#: The Center has a horror film. You wouldn't want to see that?\n#Person1#: No, indeed. I wouldn't be able to sleep tonight.\n#Person2#: That's about ell there is. Unless we change our decision and go downtown.\n#Person1#: No, we just can't pay for it. There must be something else we haven't seen.\n#Person2#: Here, look for yourself, I can't find anything else.\n#Person1#: Look at this!\n#Person2#: What?\n#Person1#: In the television timetable, there's a baseball game on television tonight.\n#Person2#: I wasn't looking for a TV program. I was looking at the movie ads.\n#Person1#: I know, but I just happened to notice it. New York is playing Boston.\n#Person2#: That must be good. I wouldn't mind watching that.\n#Person1#: OK. Let's stay home. We can go to the cinema Friday.
#Person1#: Say, Lisa, what are you watching?\n#Person2#: A Japanese film. I'm going to spend all next year in Japan, and I'd better get to know more about its culture.\n#Person1#: You mean you are accepted into the program?\n#Person2#: Sure.\n#Person1#: That's wonderful. You must be excited.\n#Person2#: Excited and nervous. You know I must work on some basic conversation skills.\n#Person1#: How much Japanese can you understand?\n#Person2#: Only a little now. But I'll attend a special language class next month.\n#Person1#: I wish I were as clever as you are in foreign languages. I'd love to study abroad.\n#Person2#: Then why don't you? The school has a lot of programs that don't require the mastery of a foreign language. You just have to be the kind of person who is and can get used to a new environment fast.\n#Person1#: I thought all programs required one to know a foreign language. Thank you for letting me know this.
#Person1#: Morning, Sue. Did you enjoy your holiday in the country?\n#Person2#: Yes, thanks. We had a great time. And some friends went with us.\n#Person1#: Where did you stay? In a hotel?\n#Person2#: No. We camped in the mountains, near Snowdon. We cooked all our meals over an open fire.\n#Person1#: Sounds wonderful. Was the weather good?\n#Person2#: The sun shone nearly every day and it didn't rain at all.\n#Person1#: Did you like the people there?\n#Person2#: Yes, they were great. We met some farmers and had tea in their houses.\n#Person1#: When did you get back? Last night?\n#Person2#: No. This morning. You'll think we were mad. We got up at 4:30, left at 5 and arrived here at 9. I'm so tired. What about you? Did you have a good weekend?\n#Person1#: Yes, but I didn't do much. I stayed at home. The weather was terrible.
#Person1#: Why didn't you tell me you had a girlfriend? \n#Person2#: Sorry, I thought you knew. \n#Person1#: But you should have told me you were in love with her. \n#Person2#: Didn't I? \n#Person1#: You know you didn't. \n#Person2#: Well, I'm telling you now. \n#Person1#: Yes, but you might have told me before. \n#Person2#: I didn't think you'd be interested. \n#Person1#: You can't be serious. How dare you not tell me you were going to marry her? \n#Person2#: Sorry, I didn't think it mattered. \n#Person1#: Oh, you men! You're all the same.

Can I offer you a glass of wine? \n#Person3#: We would love some! \n#Person1#: Here you are. A very special merlot brought directly from my home country. It has a unique ingredient which gives it a pleasant aroma and superior flavor \n#Person3#: Mmm. . . it's delicious! \n#Person2#: It's a bit bitter for my taste. . . almost tastes like. . . like. . . \n#Person3#: Ellen! Ellen! Are you okay? \n#Person1#: Did she pass out? \n#Person3#: Yeah. . . \n#Person1#: I hope that you didn't poison her drink too much! You'll ruin our meal! 
#Person1#: I just bought a new dress. What do you think of it?\n#Person2#: You look really great in it. So are you going to a job interview or a party?\n#Person1#: No, I was invited to give a talk in my school.\n#Person2#: So how much did you pay for it?\n#Person1#: I pay just $70 for it. I saved $30.\n#Person2#: That's really a bargain.\n#Person1#: You're right. Well, what did you do while I was out shopping?\n#Person2#: I watched TV for a while and then I did some reading. It wasn't a very interesting book so I just read a few pages. Then I took a shower.\n#Person1#: I thought you said you were going to see Mike.\n#Person2#: I'll go and visit him at his home tomorrow. He'll return home tomorrow morning.\n#Person1#: I'm glad he can finally returned home after that accident.

Yes, what's the number?\n#Person2#: His number is 77231059.\n#Person1#: Thank you very much.\n#Person2#: That's all right.
#Person1#: Why are you so excited, Edward? Is there anything happy?\n#Person2#: Of course. Not only happy, but also meaningful. I took the subway to school this morning. Iin the subway station, I saw one novel lying on a seat there and another near the elevator.\n#Person1#: Really? They must have been put there by someone for sharing.\n#Person2#: Yes, I was curious in red one. What a good way to kill time on the way. I plan to put my book there, too. Just for sharing.\n#Person1#: Great. But please, place it in a proper place and don't bother the traffic.\n#Person2#: OK, I will.
#Person1#: Next week is your birthday party. How exciting! What do you want for your birthday?\n#Person2#: Well, a car like yours would be fantastic.\n#Person1#: Hmm...Maybe not a car just yet. You're only turning 9, you know? How about a doll?\n#Person2#: Mom, I'm a boy. Boys don't play with stupid dolls, but a machine gun would be OK, too.\n#Person1#: Well, not this time. Maybe we could get you a nice dress and a little purse, son. Maybe...\n#Person2#: Maybe I should change my name to Mary since you seem to want a daughter so badly?
#Person1#: Are you still watching the soap opera, Nancy?\n#Person2#: Yeah. I can't take my eyes off that when it is on.\n#Person1#: Is it that appealing?\n#Person2#: Well, the cast of the opera isn't very strong and the story isn't so impressive, but the main actor's acting is really outstanding, who is handsome, too.\n#Person1#: Shall we think you need a break right now? There is a football match on channel eight.\n#Person2#: Oh, stop talking about that stupid match. I really don't understand why certain people are running after one ball.\n#Person1#: If we can choose program, I'd rather watch the documentary, this kind of soap opera is really boring.\n#Person2#: Everyone has his own taste. And have you ever heard of the saying, 'One man's meat is another's poison.'\n#Person1#: But you been in front of TV for almost 5 hours, even at dinner time. I had to say you were the most selfish person I have ever seen.\n#Person2#: Well, well, watch channel.
#Person1#: Mister Ewing said we should show up at the conference center at 4 o'clock, right?\n#Person2#: Yes, he specially asked us not to be late. Some of the people from our East York branch office are coming and he wants to make a good impression on them. How are you getting there?\n#Person1#: I was thinking of taking my car but I think I'm just going to take the underground because there is construction on the highway. What about you?\n#Person2#: I'll be taking the underground as well. Why don't we go together? I've been to the conference center only once, and I'm not sure if I can find my way around there.
#Person1#: What's the accommodation like in London Ahmed?\n#Person2#: Well, it's a bit difficult. There are thousands of overseas students here, you know.\n#Person1#: Would it be better to stay in a hotel, to share a flat, or to stay with a family?\n#Person2#: It would probably be better to stay with a family to begin with, Carla.\n#Person1#: You wouldn't recommend sharing a flat?\n#Person2#: No, I wouldn't move into a flat if I were you. You won't get much studying done in a flat. You'll spend half your time cooking and cleaning.\n#Person1#: How can I find out about families who take in students?\n#Person2#: There's a list at the student union building on campus. The people at the student union should be able to help you find a family to stay with.
#Person1#: Excuse me where is the airport?\n#Person2#: Um, it's pretty far away. I can show you on the map on my smart phone.\n#Person1#: Oh, sorry, and what I meant is how can I get there?\n#Person2#: Well, that depends. Do you want to get there quickly or cheaply?\n#Person1#: Probably the latter would be better.\n#Person2#: All right. If you go down one block and take a left, you'll see the number 12 subway station. Take the number 12 all the way to Grove Street. And then transferred to the airport express' train.\n#Person1#: How will I know where to change trains?\n#Person2#: There will be announcements on the train. But I'm sure there will also be a lot of other people with big suitcases. You can just follow them.
#Person1#: Were you a leader when you were in college?\n#Person2#: Yes. I was Propaganda department minister of our university.\n#Person1#: Did you get any honors or awards at your university?\n#Person2#: No. It ' s a pity about it.\n#Person1#: Were you involved in any club activities at your university?\n#Person2#: Yes. I was a member of the basketball Society. I like playing basketball.\n#Person1#: What extracurricular activities did you usually take part in at your college?\n#Person2#: I sometimes played basketball and sometimes played football.
#Person1#: You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to have an attorney present during questioning. If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be appointed for you. Do you understand?\n#Person2#: Yes.\n#Person1#: What's your name?\n#Person2#: My name is James.\n#Person1#: What's your nationality?\n#Person2#: American.\n#Person1#: What's your relationship with the victim?\n#Person2#: I don't know him.\n#Person1#: Why did you attack the victim?\n#Person2#: Because he beat me first when I tried to stop him from grabbing my bag and running away.\n#Person1#: How many times did you stab the victim?\n#Person2#: I stabbed his belly three times.\n#Person1#: Did you know that your actions might cause serous injuries or death?\n#Person2#: I knew, but I couldn't control myself.\n#Person1#: Was it your intention to kill the victim?\n#Person2#: No. I didn't kill him on purpose, madam. It's him who caused the incident. I need to see my attorney.\n#Person1#: OK. Give me his number and we'll contact him.

#Person1#: Hello, this is Lucie Jing calling from Lincoln Bank. May I speak to Mr. Was, please?\n#Person2#: Speaking.\n#Person1#: Ah, hello, Mr. Was. I'm just calling about your new credit card. It has arrived with us, so you can either come to collect it, or we can send it on to you.\n#Person2#: Sending it won't be necessary. I'm actually coming in for a meeting with my Personal Banker this afternoon.\n#Person1#: What perfect timing!\n#Person2#: Indeed. Is there anything I need to do before I collect it?\n#Person1#: Not really. But we do recommend you to read through our terms and conditions again before you sign the card, just in case there is something you aren't happy with.\n#Person2#: I'm sure it'll be fine. How about my PIN number?\n#Person1#: That will be sent on to you within 2 working days. Then, you can start using your new card.\n#Person2#: Great. I'll be in later today. Thanks for calling. Bye.
#Person1#: Thank you for lending me the book.\n#Person2#: Sure. But it's a very difficult one, you need to have a dictionary at your elbow.\n#Person1#: But I'm not used to looking up every new word when I'm reading a novel. I only look up the most necessary ones.
#Person1#: Let's start out to discuss the question of payment terms.\n#Person2#: I suppose you know very well that we require irrevocable letters of credit payable against presentation of shipping documents.\n#Person1#: I fully understand your position. An irrevocable letter of credit ensures that the seller gets paid in time. But, on the other hand it would add to the buying costs. We've been, after all, trading partners for 3 years and you know us well. Can't you give us D / A or D / P?\n#Person2#: I'm afraid it has been our practice so far to insist on payment by L / C.\n#Person1#: But on our part, our government is reluctant to approve of L / C payment for our imports. And there is the licensing problem.\n#Person2#: I understand that. Still, I'm not in a position to help you. Maybe we could do something later when we have had more and larger deals together.
#Person1#: Hello, what can I do for you?\n#Person2#: Um. . . Hello, I would like to open an account.\n#Person1#: OK! What kind of account do you want to open?\n#Person2#: I want to open a current account.\n#Person1#: I will open it for you right now.\n#Person2#: What's the minimum deposit for opening a current account?\n#Person1#: It's 10 yuan. How much money do you want to deposit?\n#Person2#: Well, here's 3, 000 yuan.\n#Person1#: Please write down your name, address and the amount of your deposit here. And please choose a passcode of six numbers and confirm it.\n#Person2#: OK, here you are.\n#Person1#: Thank you. Please confirm your information and sign your name in the blank.\n#Person2#: Done! What else should I do?\n#Person1#: That's all. Here's your bank card, and here's the certificate of deposit. Bring your bank card with you every time you come to deposit or withdraw money.\n#Person2#: OK. Thanks. Goodbye!\n#Person1#: Bye!
#Person1#: What do you think of the acting of the two main actors in the film?\n#Person2#: I consider the hero's acting is inferior to that of the heroine's. don't you agree?\n#Person1#: Well, I'm afraid not. I think the hero has much more to be believed in.
#Person1#: Why do you want to spend your summer days in a mountain village?\n#Person2#: I think a mountain village is splendid!\n#Person1#: I don't agree with you. It's too small to live.\n#Person2#: It has fresh air, and it is nicer than a big town.\n#Person1#: I disagree, a big town is more lively.\n#Person2#: But I like the small mountain village. The big town is noisy. How charming it is when walking along the hill!\n#Person1#: Well, alright, I agree with you about that, but I still prefer a big town.
#Person1#: What are we going to do? I can't get the car out of this ditch. I'm stuck!\n#Person2#: I'm worried, Tom. I haven't seen any other cars for almost an hour.\n#Person1#: I know. This is terrible. What can we do? This snow doesn't stop falling!\n#Person2#: I told you we should have stayed in town today. The weather report said 100 percent chance of snow. Why did you want to come up here?\n#Person1#: I wanted to show you the cabin. We only had another half-hour to go.\n#Person2#: Well, now we're stuck. What can we do?\n#Person1#: I don't know.\n#Person2#: I've heard that when this happens, it's important to save energy.\n#Person1#: What do you mean?\n#Person2#: We're stranded here, Tom. We may be here a long time. We need to conserve the gas in the car. The car's energy is what will keep us warm.\n#Person1#: I have plenty of gas.\n#Person2#: Yes, but the gas and the battery both have to stay working. We can't just let the car run and run. If we do, it will die soon. Then we'll freeze.\n#Person1#: So what can we do?\n#Person2#: Turn the lights off. Then, run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour. That will conserve the heat as long as possible.\n#Person1#: Alright. That's a good idea.\n#Person2#: I wish we hadn't come up here. Now we'll probably be here for days.\n#Person1#: Days?\n#Person2#: Yes, it happens. That is what happens in big snowstorms. People get stranded for days.\n#Person1#: Oh, my God! It's good we have food.\n#Person2#: Probably we'll survive. But turn the car off for about forty-five minutes. Then we'll turn it on again.\n#Person1#: Okay, I'll follow your advice.
#Person1#: Philip, I was really glad to hear about your award. Congratulations!\n#Person2#: Thanks, Denise. Actually, I was really surprised. I mean, there were a lot of qualified people out there.\n#Person1#: Sure. But the work you did was really exceptional! You definitely deserved it!\n#Person2#: Thanks a lot. I expect to see your name nominated pretty soon, too. You've been doing some great work!

Can I get you another glass of champagne?\n#Person2#: Yes, I'd love another glass. You're a wonderful host. Thank you for everything.\n#Person1#: It's my pleasure having you here.
#Person1#: Oh, Linda. You must be so excited about going to study in America.\n#Person2#: Oh yes I am. I have always wanted to go to the States. I love meeting new people and making new friends.\n#Person1#: Well, I am sure you will.\n#Person2#: Well, there is one thing.\n#Person1#: What is the matter?\n#Person2#: I am a little worried about my host family. You know, in the agreement, I have to do some cooking for them.\n#Person1#: Yes?\n#Person2#: Well, I am just afraid they won't like my Chinese way of cooking.\n#Person1#: Oh, listen, you'll soon learn, and I am sure they will explain to you how they like to get prepared.\n#Person2#: Oh, let's hope so.
#Person1#: Would you talk to me about taking one of Dr. Miller's classes?\n#Person2#: Yes. Have you ever been in one of his classes?\n#Person1#: I'm thinking about taking his class next semester.\n#Person2#: He was a very easy teacher. Are you thinking of taking a class with him?\n#Person1#: I'm not sure because I really need to learn something, but I also worry about grades.\n#Person2#: Grades are important, but don't you think that gaining the knowledge is important, too?\n#Person1#: I really need to learn this stuff.\n#Person2#: He made everything so interesting that the time just flew by. Do you know what I mean?\n#Person1#: Yes, that sounds right for me.\n#Person2#: Did you know that he came here last year after 10 years in the military?\n#Person1#: Yeah, I already knew that. That could be a good thing.\n#Person2#: I think you know that you have to make the best decision for you. Enjoy your year!
#Person1#: Welcome back movie lovers to another Premier Movie Review. My name is Richard Clarke and I am joined today by the very erudite David Watson.\n#Person2#: Thank you Dick. Today we are going to talk about the movie Lion King. Tell me Dave, what is your impression of this film?\n#Person1#: Well, I think this film is simply a fable, depicting man's eternal greed for power, and in my opinion, it's a very fine film. Even despite the accusations of plagiarism traditional folk tales from other countries. The musical score was amazing, the animation was very well done, and the story was simply enchanting.\n#Person2#: I think otherwise. Even though the animation was technically strong, and as you say, the score and songs performed by Elton John were great, the film lacks a certain originality ; it lacked heart. And I would dare to say, it was too predictable.\n#Person1#: Predictable! How! Come on Dick, It's a G-rated movie! It's for the kids! It's not a thriller!\n#Person2#: Well, that's just it. It did have some very dramatic and intense scenes. For example when Mufasal dies, or the dark, grim portrayal of Scar. Even so, the film is linear. Mufasal dies, Simba runs away thinking it's his fault. Falls in love and returns to retake what is rightfully his. It's just too cliche.\n#Person1#: How can it be cliche? It's a fable! It's telling a time-honoured story! The movie make a point of how the hunger for power leads to corruption, and teaches children the value of respect, life and love.\n#Person2#: You have always been so soft, Dave!\n#Person1#: Open your heart Dick. Don't shut us out.\n#Person2#: Anyway. . . That's all for today folks! Join us next time as we talk about & quot, How to lose a guy in 10 days & quot, I'm sure you'll love that one Dave!
#Person1#: How about going to dance this evening, Jane? You will find that the night life of this city is very interesting!\n#Person2#: Good idea. There is a good nightclub nearby, isn't it?\n#Person1#: Yes, the dance hall is nice with various styles of music.\n#Person2#: ( In the club ) Look at those people in the dance floor, they are so crazy.\n#Person1#: That's rock and roll with fast tempo.\n#Person2#: I like the slow dance. I am good at rumba and waltz.\n#Person1#: Take it easy. The time for slow dance is the middle part of the party.\n#Person2#: Let's find a quiet seat and sit down for beverage.\n#Person1#: OK, follow me.\n#Person2#: Listen, it is waltz. I like the elegant step of the old styles.\n#Person1#: May I?\n#Person2#: Sure.\n#Person1#: ( When they are dancing ) You dance gracefully!
#Person1#: Let's move out of here. This apartment is too small.\n#Person2#: I agree. I'll look in the paper.\n#Person1#: A house would be great. I could plant a garden. And you could use the garage for a workshop.\n#Person2#: Here's an interesting ad\n#Person1#: How much is the rent?\n#Person2#: The ad says $ 325 plus deposit.\n#Person1#: When is the place available?\n#Person2#: It's available now, and it's got a very good location. You won't be far from work.

#Person1#: Look, Jim. That man just fell down over there.\n#Person2#: We better see if he's o. k.\n#Person1#: Sir. . . sir? Are you all right? Sir?\n#Person2#: He's not answering. You'd better check his pulse and breathing.\n#Person1#: Oh, no. He's not breathing, and there's no pulse. Call 911.\n#Person2#: Hello? Yes. Someone has passed out at Connecticut Ave. and 1st St. He isn't breathing and does not have a pulse. Yes. My friend is performing CPR. OK. Thank you. They're sending an ambulance. Here, let me help.
#Person1#: Excuse me. What time does the next train to London leave?\n#Person2#: At 10:30.\n#Person1#: Is it a direct train to London?\n#Person2#: Yes, it is.\n#Person1#: OK.

It's only two minutes drive.\n#Person1#: You have to call the office first.\n#Person2#: All right. Thank you very much for your help.\n#Person1#: My pleasure.

What's your date of delivery?\n#Person1#: I informed my company and was told that the first five thousand by the end of this month.\n#Person2#: What about the balance of the order? Can they also arrive at our company quickly?\n#Person1#: We can deliver the balance at the price already quoted in 10 days.\n#Person2#: Can you deliver them earlier?\n#Person1#: I am afraid we can not do that. Would you be willing to sign an annual contract on the basis we discussed?\n#Person2#: Possibly, subject to quality and delivery guarantees.\n#Person1#: Of course. Well, in that case we could offer a 5 % discount for a confirmed monthly order for the next 12 months.\n#Person2#: I was looking forward to something a bit more substantial. As you know, we have long-time cooperation.\n#Person1#: I'm afraid that's as far as we could go. We'd already be stretching ourselves to the limit.\n#Person2#: Well, let's shake on that and draw up the details of the contract.
#Person1#: Hello, reservation desk. Can I help you?\n#Person2#: Yes. I'd like to book a duplex suite.\n#Person1#: What day would you like to reserve the suite for, sir?\n#Person2#: Next Friday.\n#Person1#: I'm sorry, sir.

( XXXXXXXXXX )\n#Person2#: Tom, if you can hear me, I think we've lost you. There's a problem with the line. Let's try again. We'll call you.\n#Person1#: ( XXXXXXXXXX ) OK ( XXXXXXXXXX ).
#Person1#: Hello!\n#Person2#: Hello, Lucy. This is John. Could you do me a favor? I've tried to phone my wife six times and I can't get through. The line is busy all the time. Could you possibly go next door and give her a message?\n#Person1#: Sure! What do you want to tell Mary?\n#Person2#: Could you just say I've met an old friend and I'm staying with him?

And it is your own place...good location, near the Tube.\n#Person1#: Look...I can stretch to 200 a week...I can't afford 250 plus all the other bills.\n#Person2#: All right.

#Person1#: How is your mother feeling these days?\n#Person2#: Much better, thanks. She'll be back home in a few days.\n#Person1#: That's wonderful. When will you be back on your job?\n#Person2#: I think I need a week to take care of her and do some cleaning for her coming home.\n#Person1#: Why don't you hire someone to do it? In this case, you cannot only do your job, but also have more free time.\n#Person2#: Yes, I know it. But I'm really worried about my mother. She is 72 years old.\n#Person1#: You're a kind and thoughtful man. I admire you very much.\n#Person2#: I'm just a very normal son.
#Person1#: Oh, no! I'm supposed to meet her at seven sharp. What time is it now?\n#Person2#: Six thirty.\n#Person1#: I'd better get ready.\n#Person2#: Where are you going?\n#Person1#: Haven't made up our minds yet. Maybe to a restaurant, or perhaps to the movies first.\n#Person2#: Why don't you go and see Citizen Kane at the Classic Film Festival? It's supposed to be great.\n#Person1#: Oh, maybe we will. Psycho is also playing. I've heard it's really good, too.\n#Person2#: If you like horror films with lots of blood. Personally I don't. Well, I really should be going. Do you want to go swimming tomorrow?\n#Person1#: I'd be glad to, but I might have to go to the studio and do some work. Can I let you know the first thing in the morning?\n#Person2#: Sure. That'll be fine.\n#Person1#: Oh, there's the phone. It must be Tracy.\n#Person2#: Well, I'd better be going then. Have a good time tonight.\n#Person1#: Thanks. I'll talk to you tomorrow.
#Person1#: The new baby must be keeping you up at all hours of the night.\n#Person2#: She's been pretty good since my mother moved in, and she's sleeping for a longer time at night. It's my thoughts as a mother that keep me awake at night.

#Person1#: Bob, I'm sure you know about second-hand smoke.\n#Person2#: Of course, I do.\n#Person1#: But have you heard about third-hand smoke?\n#Person2#: Third-hand smoke? I'm afraid not. What is that then?\n#Person1#: Well, it is here in today's paper. Parents may think they are protecting children from second-hand smoke when they smoke outside their home or only when the children are not there. But now researchers are warning about what they call third-hand smoke. When you smoke dangerous matter from cigarettes get into your hair and clothing. As babies are the weakest, when you come to a baby, you pass it to the baby and increase the chances of disease in the baby.\n#Person2#: Is that so? In that case I have to say that I should never get close to a baby.\n#Person1#: That's right. Actually all smoking parents should do the same or better give it up completely.
#Person1#: Hey, man. What's up?\n#Person2#: Ah, first of all, I put a buck in the vending machine for a seventy-five cent candy bar, and the thing got stuck here in the machine. Then, I pressed the change button [Ah, man], and nothing happened. [Wow!] Nothing came out. The dumb thing still owes me a quarter.\n#Person1#: Well, did you talk to the man at the snack bar to see if he could refund your money?\n#Person2#: Yeah, I tried that, but he said he didn't own the machine, and I'd have to call the phone number on the machine.\n#Person1#: What a bummer.\n#Person2#: Hey, I have an idea. [What?] Why don't we rock the machine back and forth until the candy bar falls?\n#Person1#: Nothing doing. I don't want to be responsible for breaking the thing, and besides, someone might call the cops.\n#Person2#: Ah, don't worry. I've done it before. Oh well. Hey, hey, tough luck. Hey, here, take my candy bar. [You mean?] Yeah, the machine and I hit it off earlier today.

What experience have you had?\n#Person2#: Well, I've just left school, actually, and I'm looking for a job between now and when I go to college.\n#Person1#: It doesn't sound as though we can help, Katie. You see, our clients are very demanding, especially when it comes to the new office technology.\n#Person2#: Oh, that's no problem. I took extra classes in office skills at school.\n#Person1#: Oh, perhaps you'd like to outline what you've been doing?\n#Person2#: I started by learning keyboard skills. Then I went on to learn about word processing.\n#Person1#: Good. You seem qualified from the technical point of view.
#Person1#: Why did the teacher criticise Myra in front of the whole class? \n#Person2#: Because Myra was cheating on exams, and she spoke back rudely. \n#Person1#: I don't think that Myra should have spoken so rudely to the teacher. I know she was angry, but that's still no excuse for rudeness. 
#Person1#: May I have your order now? \n#Person2#: We'd have your regular dinner. What courses are there, please? \n#Person1#: The courses for our regular dinner are fish salad for appetizer, steak for main course and chocolate cake for dessert.\n#Person2#: All right, we'll have it. \n#Person1#: Today's mutton chop is very good.

Hop in, please. \n#Person1#: Excuse me, how long does it take to get there? \n#Person2#: It usually takes about half an hour. \n#Person1#: Oh, does it really a long way to go. \n#Person2#: Yes. Moreover, since the street is heavy with traffic this time of day. I'm not sure we can make it. By the way, are you pressed for the time? \n#Person1#: No, I'm not. you can just drive slowly and carefully. \n#Person2#: OK. \n#Person1#: You are very skillful driver. \n#Person2#: Thank you. \n#Person1#: By the way, is the fair the same for any distance? \n#Person2#: No. It varies according to the distance, you can read from the meter.\n#Person1#: Oh, I see. 
#Person1#: For tomorrow, read pages 12 to 20. Then do exercises one through ten on page 21. \n#Person2#: Do we have to type out our homework? \n#Person1#: No. You only do that when you write reports. \n#Person2#: Is there anything else? \n#Person1#: For those of you who don't have a calculator, get one. \n#Person2#: We are allowed to use a calculator in class? \n#Person1#: Yes. By the way, review today's notes this evening. We may have a small quiz tomorrow. 
#Person1#: Can you tell me about some good deals on produce? \n#Person2#: The mangoes are on sale today. \n#Person1#: What exactly are mangoes? \n#Person2#: They have yellowish red skin. It's a fruit with one big seed. \n#Person1#: Is the seed edible? \n#Person2#: Maybe if you were a parrot. I wouldn't recommend it. \n#Person1#: How much does a mango cost? \n#Person2#: Normally, they're $2 each. Today, they're only $1 each. \n#Person1#: Maybe I won't like the taste. \n#Person2#: It's hard to describe. They're sweet, but also sort of citrusy. \n#Person1#: How do I tell the difference between a ripe one and an unripe one? \n#Person2#: They're similar to an avocado. When the outside feels soft, they're ripe. \n#Person1#: Where do most of them come from? \n#Person2#: These are from Mexico. 
#Person1#: It seems that something is praying heavy on you. What's the matter? \n#Person2#: I got my father's goat last night. \n#Person1#: What did you do to get his goat? \n#Person2#: When I asked him to treat me like he does to my sisters, he jumped down my throat. So I took it out on him by telling him what I thought. 
#Person1#: How do you do, Mr. Smith ? This is Lili. I'm calling to thank you for the wonderful dinner we had yesterday . I enjoyed it very much. \n#Person2#: You're welcome.

I am pleased to help you. \n#Person1#: If there's anything that I can help you in the future, please let me know. \n#Person2#: I'll do that. Thank you. Have a safe trip home. 
#Person1#: Daniel, have you ever heard about the wildlife sanctuary? \n#Person2#: Is that different from this kind of zoo? \n#Person1#: Yes, of course. \n#Person2#: So tell me about it! \n#Person1#: There are a lot of wild animals in that place, and also some special rules while visiting. \n#Person2#: Special rules? \n#Person1#: There, you only have two ways for visiting. \n#Person2#: Details? \n#Person1#: On their bus or in your own cars, and you won't be allowed to get off the bus until you reach the special region. \n#Person2#: Why not? \n#Person1#: Because it is dangerous to get out of the car or bus. You can just imagine how fierce the wild animals can be. \n#Person2#: That makes sense. But that sounds interesting. Is there one in Beijing too? \n#Person1#: Yes. \n#Person2#: I prefer to go there next time. \n#Person1#: Yeah, sure, you won't be disappointed.

I'm on a business trip, so I need a single room.\n#Person1#: OK, your name please.\n#Person2#: John Griffin. That's JOHNGRIFFIN.\n#Person1#: OK, I've got that down. Wait a minute. We already have your name. You've been here before, haven't you? Or it must be someone with the same name.\n#Person2#: I've stayed with you twice before.\n#Person1#: OK. Let's see the card and confirm it. Please tell me if I'm wrong. John Griffin from Sydney, Passport Number 87637489. Right?\n#Person2#: That's right.\n#Person1#: OK. So what time can we expect you tonight, Mr. Griffin?\n#Person2#: The plane lands at 9:15 PM and no one can pick me up. So I should be at your place at 10:00. Will the restaurant still open at that time?\n#Person1#: I'm afraid not. Can I organize some snacks to be left in your room?\n#Person2#: Yes, that would be great. How about a cheese sandwich?\n#Person1#: No problem, sir. I'll see to that.
#Person1#: Hello, Barbara. Welcome back. You look great.\n#Person2#: Rod, it's lovely to see you again.\n#Person1#: How was your trip?\n#Person2#: Fine, but tiring. Milan was interesting. It's bigger than I expected, noisier and dirtier too.\n#Person1#: And Florence? What did you think of Florence?\n#Person2#: Well, I didn't go there. Have you been there?\n#Person1#: No, I've never been to Italy. I'd really like to go to Rome. Well, the car's in the car park. Is this all your suitcase?\n#Person2#: Yes, but the suitcase is very heavy.\n#Person1#: Barbara, what's in it? Books or stones?\n#Person2#: Just 20 pairs of shoes.
#Person1#: Excuse me, my watch stopped running and I am not sure what's wrong with it.\n#Person2#: Well, let me look at it. It seems that it just needs a new battery.\n#Person1#: Oh, really? I got some water on it last week and I was afraid that it might ruin the watch. How much is a new battery?\n#Person2#: It's $5 and we not only change a battery, but also guarantee it for a year and if you have the watch cleaned here, we can guarantee it for an additional 3 months.\n#Person1#: That sounds like a good deal. I'll get my battery here. When will it be ready?\n#Person2#: Usually I can do it right away, but now I'm repairing lots of watches. Can you leave your watch here until 5:00 PM?\n#Person1#: OK. See you then.
#Person1#: Let's plan, the dinner for the end of the year.\n#Person2#: I've been talking to some of the other kids in the class and quite a few of them want to go to a pizza restaurant.\n#Person1#: Um, I think I've had enough of pizza. I eat it at least twice a week, it be good to have something different.\n#Person2#: Well, there's that Chinese restaurant. The bamboo house.\n#Person1#: It's closing next week for a month. They're going to build a new kitchen or something. I remember going to someplace with a singer and guitarist. And it was great.\n#Person2#: But there will be at least 20 of us, will be so noisy that we won't hear the music.\n#Person1#: You're right. Hey, we haven't thought about the cost. Some people will want to go to a cheap place, and others can afford somewhere more expensive.\n#Person2#: Why don't we fix the amount first and ask a restaurant to provide a meal for that price?\n#Person1#: That's a good idea. And we can make a list of the places we think our best, and get the rest of the class to choose one.
#Person1#: Hello Martin, long time no see. I heard you went to France to study, how was that?\n#Person2#: I was only there for a year, then I took a year off to travel around Europe.\n#Person1#: Where did you go?\n#Person2#: I went to Switzerland first and then Germany in Austria. I was planning to end my trip in Italy, but it didn't work out.\n#Person1#: Oh well, is it good to be back?\n#Person2#: Of course, but I'm returning to France to finish my degree. It's a four-year program.\n#Person1#: Oh, so you're just back to Beijing to visit your family?\n#Person2#: Yeah, I'm here for another 2 months.\n#Person1#: Any plans?\n#Person2#: In July, my mother is turning 70, so we'll do something special for her. Next month we're going to drive to the coast, then I will be back to France before September first.\n#Person1#: Good for you, do you think you could fit me into your busy schedule?\n#Person2#: Ha, I can always make time for my friends, how about tonight?\n#Person1#: Deal.
#Person1#: Excuse me, do you have a few minutes? I work for the Star Bookstore, and we are doing a survey about people's reading habits. I want to ask you a couple of questions.\n#Person2#: Yes, alright. What would you like to know?\n#Person1#: Well, what kinds of books do you prefer to read?\n#Person2#: Hmm, I absolutely love adventure stories best. I am also interested in historical novels. And recently, I've read several biographies.\n#Person1#: OK. Where do you buy your books? In stores or on the Internet?\n#Person2#: About 2/3 of my books are bought from online bookstores. Sometimes I go to a bookstore if I see something interesting in the window. I also borrow books from friends or from the library.\n#Person1#: Great. Thank you for your time. Have a nice day.\n#Person2#: No problem. Good day to you.
#Person1#: What kind of place shall we rent?\n#Person2#: It should be close to the university. Neither of us are good at getting up in the mornings and closer it is, the later we can get up.\n#Person1#: Absolutely. That's the most important thing to take into consideration. I'm not too worried about the size of the flat.\n#Person2#: Neither am I. So a small place is ok, but we'll get a bigger one if it's not expensive. Do you mind if it's in a noisy area?\n#Person1#: I don't mind. i'm not a light sleeper, but quieter is better for when we have to study at home.\n#Person2#: Good point. Ok, let's go to the estate agent and see what they can offer us.\n#Person1#: Yes, if we're lucky we'll find something in the next few days. I think you had a good idea to start flat hunting early.\n#Person2#: How much do you think the rent will be?\n#Person1#: I asked a few people who are already living in places near the university and they said it would cost about one hundred pounds a month.
#Person1#: Hello! Can I help you?\n#Person2#: Today is my wife's birthday, so I want to buy a bouquet for her.\n#Person1#: What kind of flowers do you want?\n#Person2#: I have no idea.\n#Person1#: How about rose? It's the most suitable one for lovers.\n#Person2#: But rose is too common.\n#Person1#: Well, what about violet? It means the eternal beauty.\n#Person2#: It looks good. Pack me a bouquet of violet, please.
#Person1#: I have a problem with my cable.\n#Person2#: What about it?\n#Person1#: My cable has been out for the past week or so.\n#Person2#: The cable is down right now. I am very sorry.\n#Person1#: When will it be working again?\n#Person2#: It should be back on in the next couple of days.\n#Person1#: Do I still have to pay for the cable?\n#Person2#: We're going to give you a credit while the cable is down.\n#Person1#: So, I don't have to pay for it?\n#Person2#: No, not until your cable comes back on.\n#Person1#: Okay, thanks for everything.\n#Person2#: You're welcome, and I apologize for the inconvenience.
#Person1#: Can I help you?\n#Person2#: I'm looking for an MP - 3 player. Which brand is of the highest quality?\n#Person1#: I recommend Pioneer.\n#Person2#: Which model is the best-seller?\n#Person1#: This model is very popular with ladies.\n#Person2#: May I have a look at it?\n#Person1#: Sure, it's multi-functional. Besides playing music, it can also be used to store documents and make recordings.\n#Person2#: Do you have this model in white?\n#Person1#: No, but we have it in yellow.\n#Person2#: Then I'll take the yellow one.\n#Person1#: Please wait a second. I'll get it for you.\n#Person2#: Okay.
#Person1#: Susan! Why didn't you tell me that you were taking over the Silk Company account?\n#Person2#: I thought you knew, Todd. It was decided last week. I guess you weren't at the meeting.\n#Person1#: You know I wasn't at the meeting. I was meeting with Mr. Wei about this account. I'Ve been on this for a month and a half.\n#Person2#: I'm sorry. Todd, but Mr. Emory felt that it was going too slowly, and that it needed a fresh start. He should have told you.
#Person1#: What's up, buddy? You look so upset.\n#Person2#: I just broke up with a girl. Why didn't she understand that I loved her?\n#Person1#: I'm sorry to hear that. What's your conflict?\n#Person2#: I don't know. She always said I didn't love her, but I did.\n#Person1#: Did you think about talking to her again? Maybe she is waiting for your call.\n#Person2#: I have asked for a talk again, but she refused and said she wanted to be quiet.\n#Person1#: Come on, guy. Maybe she isn't your right person.
#Person1#: Merry Christmas, Lily.\n#Person2#: The same to you, Joey.\n#Person1#: This is your first Christmas in the US. Here is the gift for you.\n#Person2#: It's very thoughtful of you.

#Person1#: I hate landing in the sand trap! Now I'm probably going to waste strokes getting it out.\n#Person2#: At least you haven't landed in the water yet. I've done that on the last two holes.\n#Person1#: Could you hand me my wedge? I'll try. . .\n#Person2#: Here you go. I'll wait for you to get on the green before I putt.\n#Person1#: No. you go ahead and putt it out. Then I'Il go.\n#Person2#: No way, Mary. I'm going to let you go first. I don't want the pressure of putting first.
#Person1#: Have you heard about the new iPhone?\n#Person2#: yes, I heard it's supposed to come out in June. Are you thinking about getting one?\n#Person1#: I'd like to. It's a cell phone, camera, PAD and mp3 player all in one.\n#Person2#: if I had enough money, I'd buy one, but I don't even have enough to buy one of their shuffle spods.\n#Person1#: how big is a shuffle iPod?\n#Person2#: the first generation iPod shuffle is about the size of a park of gum and the second generation iPod shuffle is about half the size of the first.\n#Person1#: how many gigs of music can it hold?\n#Person2#: I think it's either one or two gigs.

Though an iPod might have an above average battery life, once the battery is dead, so is your iPod.
#Person1#: Have any plans for the weekend, Tom?\n#Person2#: Yeah, I'm going for a hike in the southern Rocky Mountains.\n#Person1#: Oh, do you go hiking often?\n#Person2#: I go as much as I can. I love hiking because you can really get in touch with nature.\n#Person1#: It would be nice to get out of the city. Do you want some company?\n#Person2#: Sure. But, it will be a long hike, 30 miles in three days. Have you been hiking before?\n#Person1#: Yeah, I go a lot too. I saw a bear and a mountain lion on my last hike.\n#Person2#: Wow! You must have been pretty far away from the city.\n#Person1#: Yeah, my friend and I hiked in a very wild part of the national forest.\n#Person2#: Well, bring him along too. We'll have a great time this weekend.\n#Person1#: Thanks, I'll ask him.

But this isn't a no-smoker, is it? I mean would you mind if I smoke here?\n#Person2#: Actually it is. Perhaps you haven't noticed the sign.\n#Person1#: Sign?

#Person1#: I really want to take a nap. I feel very sleepy today.\n#Person2#: What's the matter? Didn't you get enough sleep last night?\n#Person1#: I fell asleep very late. It was almost two o'clock in the morning when I finally fell asleep.\n#Person2#: Are you worried about something? Why couldn't you sleep?\n#Person1#: You know how it is when you're in a strange country. Everything is new, and you get tired and nervous sometimes. Then you worry about your family, about conditions back home, about your courses, about your money, about everything. I tried to fall asleep but I just had too much on my mind.\n#Person2#: Well, take it easy. Things will look better tomorrow. Maybe you should try exercising or a hot bath to help you relax.\n#Person1#: Anything is worth a try. But right now I really just want to find a quiet place to take a nap.
#Person1#: What is your favorite coffee?\n#Person2#: Irish coffee is my favorite. But I'm not particular on it.\n#Person1#: All right. Would you make coffee yourself when you are at home?\n#Person2#: Not very often. Making coffee is a bit troublesome. Most of the time, I just buy takeout at Starbucks. And also, I quite like instant coffee.\n#Person1#: I think instant coffee is becoming more and more popular. Though its taste is not perfect, it's really cheap and convenient.\n#Person2#: Exactly. Nescafe is the world's favorite coffee. People love it all over the world.\n#Person1#: I agree. I heard that in the western countries, almost everyone likes coffee. Is that true?\n#Person2#: Yes. No doubt about that. For us, coffee is more a living style rather than a simple drink. I heard Chinese people don't drink that much coffee.\n#Person1#: No, we don't, especially the elder people. But more and more young people fall for coffee nowadays.\n#Person2#: I suppose so. That's probably why there are so many wonderful coffee houses in China now.
#Person1#: Hi, is that Mr. Wu?\n#Person2#: Yes. What can I do for you?\n#Person1#: I am calling to query about some of your information.\n#Person2#: We've got a bad line.

That's a fair price.\n#Person2#: Now, as for the room, sir, do you prefer smoking or nonsmoking?\n#Person1#: Nonsmoking, please.\n#Person2#: Nonsmoking. Now, sir, does a single queen-size bed meet your approval?\n#Person1#: I have absolutely no problem with that.\n#Person2#: Queen, nonsmoking. Okay, sir, your room is reserved. Now if you'll just give me your phone number.\n#Person1#: Not a problem. The number is 626-555-1739.\n#Person2#: Thank you for making a reservation with us. We look forward to seeing you in April!
#Person1#: Do you have any direct flights to Toronto?\n#Person2#: Sorry, we don't. But I think you can fly on Northwest Airlines to Berlin and then have a connecting flight on Canada Airline to Toronto. And it is the most economical flight, just 1, 900 dollars.\n#Person1#: When does the flight depart?\n#Person2#: At 8 am. By the way, it also makes a refueling stop.\n#Person1#: How long is the layover?\n#Person2#: Less than one hour.\n#Person1#: And how long do I have to stay in Berlin for the connecting flight?\n#Person2#: Not so long, just one hour.\n#Person1#: So the time for the total journey is about. . . ?\n#Person2#: About 13 hours.\n#Person1#: Let me count. Ok, it works out for my schedule. Thanks a lot!\n#Person2#: You are welcome!
#Person1#: I'm sorry, I've lost my tags and receipt. What can I do about it?\n#Person2#: I see. What is your baggage? And do you remember the tag's number or color?\n#Person1#: It's a suitcase. Its colour is blue.\n#Person2#: Could you give me a description of your case?\n#Person1#: It's like this, it's square with a leather cover.\n#Person2#: I'll check it for you. I've found it. Is this yours?\n#Person1#: Yes, it is the right one\n#Person2#: Will you show me your key card, please?\n#Person1#: Here it is.\n#Person2#: All right. Now you can take your case away
#Person1#: Mr. Phillips? I have a request here from purchasing that needs your approval.\n#Person2#: Let me take a look. This is for a 486 computer with modem. Who's it going to?\n#Person1#: I believe it's going to Ms. Wilson's office.\n#Person2#: Get her on the phone, please. I need to clarify this.
#Person1#: I will have sole then.\n#Person2#: All right, how about the other guests.\n#Person1#: The rest of us will have this today's special, please.\n#Person2#: Ok.\n#Person1#: I am sorry but I ordered sole not the same as the others. Will you change it?\n#Person2#: I'm afraid we have no more sole.\n#Person1#: Then I'll have the pork cutlet instead.\n#Person2#: Certainly, just a moment, sir.
#Person1#: Do you have any experience working with a computer?\n#Person2#: Yes. I have been a data entry operator for three years.\n#Person1#: What kind of software can you use?\n#Person2#: I have working knowledge of Windows and Dos. Actually, I'm quite familiar with both Java and C Programming Languages.\n#Person1#: Do you have any other computer qualifications?\n#Person2#: I have an ACRE certificate, GRADE 2.\n#Person1#: Do you know how to use a PC to process the management information?\n#Person2#: I'm sorry to say I'm not familiar with processing management information, but I'm sure I could learn quite quickly. It can't be too difficult, and I've got a quick mind. I can handle any problem you give me.
#Person1#: Hello, welcome to Credit Services. How can we help you?\n#Person2#: I'm interested in applying for a credit card with you.\n#Person1#: Are you an existing customer?\n#Person2#: Yes, I've had a Current Account with a debit card with you for years. Now, I'm looking at upgrading to a credit card.\n#Person1#: May I ask why you didn't think of applying for a credit card with us sooner? Most young people jump at the chance.\n#Person2#: When I opened the account with you, I was a student, I graduated a couple of years ago and have a steady salary, so I figured now would be the best time to go ahead.\n#Person1#: That's very sensible of you. We have many fresh graduates applying for credit cards, getting them and then going on a spending spree and being unable to meet the repayments.\n#Person2#: As you can see from the statements for my Current Account, I have never been overdrawn. I'm always very careful about that.
#Person1#: Good morning, City Taxi.\n#Person2#: Good morning. I'd like to book a taxi to the airport for Saturday morning, please.\n#Person1#: Where from?\n#Person2#: I'm at Garden Hotel in Union Street. There will be three of us sharing. How much will it be?\n#Person1#: About 60 dollars.\n#Person2#: 60 dollars? Each of between us?\n#Person1#: Oh, that's all together. What time do you want to leave?\n#Person2#: Seven in the morning.\n#Person1#: Right! We'll pick you up at your hotel at seven then.\n#Person2#: Thank you very much. Goodbye.
#Person1#: Hi. My name's Carl. Nice to meet you.\n#Person2#: Nice to meet you, too. My name is Francisco.\n#Person1#: What?\n#Person2#: Francisco, but all my friends and family back in Peru call me Pancho.\n#Person1#: Okay, Pancho. So, tell me about your family?\n#Person2#: Well, I have seven brothers and six sisters.\n#Person1#: Wow. That is a big family. So are you the oldest, Pancho?\n#Person2#: No. I'm the second oldest in my family.\n#Person1#: So, what do your parents do?\n#Person2#: My father is a taxi driver in Lima, Peru. It's a hard job, but he works hard to support the family.\n#Person1#: How about your mother?\n#Person2#: She helps run a small family store with some of my older brothers and sisters.\n#Person1#: What kind of store?\n#Person2#: We mainly sell food, like bread, eggs, soft drinks, rice, sugar, and cookies. Things that people buy every day.
#Person1#: Hi, Jane. I'd like to discuss something with you. Do you have a minute?\n#Person2#: Sure. I've just got out of my eleven o'clock class. I don't have another class until this afternoon.\n#Person1#: Good. Listen, I've just received an e-mail from the computer centre. They are looking for students to help with the work of the school website this summer. They need two assistants. They asked me if I knew anyone that might be interested. I thought you might like to consider the job.\n#Person2#: Sounds interesting. I can type, but I don't have a lot of experience.\n#Person1#: Well, I don't think any special experience or knowledge is necessary. And with your interests in computers and the Internet, I think you would be good for the job. Also they're paying good money. What do you think?\n#Person2#: It sounds like a great chance to get some experience. Thanks for thinking of me.
#Person1#: Oh, I am starving.\n#Person2#: Me too. Shall we eat out? There is a new French restaurant down the street.\n#Person1#: Oh, forget about it. I went there with a friend last week. The menu was all in French and I just couldn't read it.\n#Person2#: That's what you are paying for.\n#Person1#: Maybe. But I should say everything was expensive and nothing was to my satisfaction.\n#Person2#: Then how about the Italian restaurant on the next block.\n#Person1#: Well. I ate out almost every day last week. Let's just eat in today.\n#Person2#: But I am not in the mood to cook.\n#Person1#: I will cook then. In fact, I am sick and tired of restaurant. I just want a home-cook meal.
#Person1#: I have a complaint to make, Sir. I had waited ten minutes at the table before the waiter showed up, and I finally got served. And I found it was not what I ordered.\n#Person2#: I am terribly sorry, madam. It's a bit unusually busy tonight. As a compensation, your meal will be free.
#Person1#: It is exciting just to think about it! It'll be my first trip to Hawaii. But I may have trouble finding my way around there when I'm there.\n#Person2#: Don't worry about that. Just give me a call when you arrive. I'll be glad to show you around.
#Person1#: You've had a very dangerous life, haven't you, Joe?\n#Person2#: Yes. That's right.\n#Person1#: When was your worst accident?\n#Person2#: Last year. It was during the British Grand Prix. I knocked into a wall. The car was completely destroyed and my left leg was broken. Luckily nobody was killed.\n#Person1#: Is that the only time you've been..., er... close to death?\n#Person2#: No, I had a very frightening experience quite recently. I was frightened to death! I thought I was going to be killed at any moment.\n#Person1#: Really? When was that?\n#Person2#: It was on my way to this studio. I had to drive through London during the lunch hour.
#Person1#: Hello, Mrs. Turnbull. How are you? \n#Person2#: Fine, thanks. How's your boy, Jack? \n#Person1#: He's a bit tired. You know, he goes to school at eight o'clock every morning. He doesn't get home till after four. then he does his homework after tea. It often takes him a couple of hours to finish \n#Person2#: Poor boy. They work hard at school nowadays, don't they? Does he like it? \n#Person1#: School, you mean? Yes, he does. He likes his teachers, and that always makes adifference. \n#Person2#: Yes, it does. Does he go to school by bus? \n#Person1#: No, he walks. He likes walking. He meets some of his friends at the corner andthey go together. \n#Person2#: What does he do when it rains? \n#Person1#: My husband takes him in the car. He passes the school on the way to the office. 
#Person1#: Hi, Craig! How are you? \n#Person2#: Not so good. I have a terrible cold. \n#Person1#: Really? That's too bad! You should be at home in bed. It's really important to get a lot of rest. \n#Person2#: Yeah, you're right. \n#Person1#: And have you taken anything for it? \n#Person2#: No, I haven't. \n#Person1#: Well, it's helpful to chop up some garlic and cook it in chicken stock. Then drink a cup every half hour. It really works! \n#Person2#: Ugh! 
#Person1#: Hi, Lilly, it's so nice to see you again. \n#Person2#: Hum, me too. This winter holiday was especially long. What have you done? \n#Person1#: Nothing special. I had a get-together with some schoolmates at the high school, visited the Internet and read a couple of books which I had been longing for. How about yours? \n#Person2#: You know, I like traveling. I made good use of this long vacation and enjoyed myself. 
#Person1#: How can you keep in touch with your aunt in America? \n#Person2#: Oh, I make a phone call once a month. \n#Person1#: It's very expensive, right? \n#Person2#: Yeah. \n#Person1#: Why not send E-mail through the Internet ? \n#Person2#: Is it convenient and cheap? \n#Person1#: Sure. You can send E-mail to each other every day through the internet. In addition, you can make a phone call through the internet , too. \n#Person2#: Really? I'm so glad to hear that. But I don't konw how to get access to the Internet. Could you show me? \n#Person1#: No problem. I'll tell you. \n#Person2#: I'll appreciate it very much. 
#Person1#: Is that true? \n#Person2#: I guess so. Now Anna's got four kids and another on the way. \n#Person1#: Wow. She looks good for having had that many kids. She's pregnant and wearing Prada! \n#Person2#: That's Anna for you. She keeps up the image of the stylish Italian woman. Here she comes. \n#Person1#: She's glowing. It must be the pregnancy. \n#Person2#: Yeah, or the expensive Italian facial treatments. 
#Person1#: Hey, the pool's open now! \n#Person2#: As of today it is. Memorial Day marks the end of the school year and the beginning of summer. \n#Person1#: So it's time for the kids to get outdoors. . . \n#Person2#: . . . and for us to get tans in our new bikinis. \n#Person1#: Not this Taiwanese girl. We don't like to get suntans. \n#Person2#: That's smart these days with all the news on skin cancer. Hey, there's everybody! We made it! 
#Person1#: Hi, Nancy. How are you doing? \n#Person2#: Hi, Tom. Want a cup of coffee? \n#Person1#: Not right now. I've got to get another car and my old one is blown up. \n#Person2#: Oh, hey, did you look in the classified ads? \n#Person1#: You mean used car? \n#Person2#: No, Ah. . . single sellers. \n#Person1#: Well, yeah, but I'd be getting somebody else's problem. \n#Person2#: Uh huh. How about a used car? They've got good ones now. \n#Person1#: It's the same kind of deal though, you know, you never know what you're going to get. \n#Person2#: Oh, hey, how about a new car? They've got easy loans now. You'd feel so good driving a new car. \n#Person1#: Let's look at them all. Have you got a paper there? 
#Person1#: Who was that guy you were talking to at the bar? It looked like he was hitting on you. \n#Person2#: Yeah, we struck up a conversation, and eventually he asked me out. I gave him my number, but I'm not sure if I'll actually go out with him. \n#Person1#: Oh? How come? \n#Person2#: He's nice, but I just don't feel like we have much chemistry, so I don't want to lead him on.\n#Person1#: Well, don't be too quick to judge. My last boyfriend and I didn't hit it off right away, I only started to fall for him after we went out a few times and I got to know him better. We were together for 3 years.\n#Person2#: So why'd you split up? If you don't mind my asking. \n#Person1#: Not at all. We just started to drift apart, different interests, different plans for the future. The breakup was mutual.\n#Person2#: Ah, that's great. My last relationship was a nightmare, I hooked up with a guy at a New Year's party and we were together for six months, but we were constantly fighting and making up. I don't know how I put up with him for so long.\n#Person1#: How'd it end? \n#Person2#: He cheated on me, I caught him making out with his ex. He begged me for another chance, but I know he was just trying to jerk me around, so I said no.\n#Person1#: Ugh! Good for you. \n#Person2#: Thanks. So how about you, are you going out with anyone at the moment?\n#Person1#: Oh, I've gone on a few dates here and there, but nothing serious. To be honest, I'm not really interested in settling down just yet, I'm enjoying the single life too much.
#Person1#: Um, which of them is the better typist? \n#Person2#: Well, Mary types faster than Jones. But I think Jones types more carefully. \n#Person1#: Is there any difference in their short hand? \n#Person2#: Jones can certainly take down letter more quickly, but Mary's short hand is the best in her class. \n#Person1#: How about languages? \n#Person2#: Both of them speak excellent French. But I think Mary speaks German more fluently than Jones does. \n#Person1#: Um. That doesn't really matter. Because we have more French visitors than German. 
#Person1#: It's a terrible day, isn't it?\n#Person2#: Yes, it is. This is why our flight was delayed for 2 hours. My parents should be worried about me. They are waiting for me at London airport.\n#Person1#: Where did you come from?\n#Person2#: Beijing. I was there for a 2 weeks' conference on space technology.\n#Person1#: How interesting! I was there for tour. You see, I usually have a tour twice or 3 times a year.\n#Person2#: Really? Which places did you visit in China?\n#Person1#: Apart from Beijing, we went to Nanjing, Shanghai, Xi'an, Hangzhou, and Guangzhou.\n#Person2#: Did you enjoy it?\n#Person1#: Very much. It was one of the most exciting tours I've ever made. Was this your first trip to China?\n#Person2#: Oh, no. I go almost every year. Unfortunately, it's always on space related business. I haven't had time to visit tour sites.\n#Person1#: Oh, what a pity.
#Person1#: Now, mister Snow. What can you remember about the attack?\n#Person2#: Well, I was working late yesterday evening.\n#Person1#: What time did you leave your office?\n#Person2#: About 9:44.\n#Person1#: Are you sure?\n#Person2#: Oh yes, I looked at my watch.\n#Person1#: What did you do then?\n#Person2#: Well, I locked the door, and I was walking to my car when somebody hit me on the head.\n#Person1#: Did you see the attacker?\n#Person2#: No, he was wearing a stocking over his head?\n#Person1#: Tell me mister snow. How did you break your leg?\n#Person2#: Well, when the doctors were pudding me into the car. They dropped me.
#Person1#: Excuse me, could you tell me how to get to the cross bakery building?\n#Person2#: The cross bakery building? Sure, you're actually walking in the opposite direction.\n#Person1#: Oh, you're kidding. I thought I was heading east.\n#Person2#: No, east is the other direction. To get to the bakery, you need to turn around and go 3 blocks to broadway, when you get to broadway, you need to take a left, go straight down that street for 2 blocks, and then you'll see the building on your left. It's just between the post office and a supermarket.\n#Person1#: Ok, let me see if I've got that, first turn around, 3 blocks to broadway, and then a left turn and 2 blocks to the building, is that right?\n#Person2#: Yeah, you've got it.
#Person1#: I wish we had hired a professional person to film it. Instead of asking your friend Lenny to do it.\n#Person2#: This video isn't so bad. The quality isn't the best, but he does a pretty good job.\n#Person1#: It's not bad if you like your unclear video. There are no changes between scenes and the lighting is terrible. At best, it looks like a rough video that has not been completely edited.\n#Person2#: It is a little rough, I admit.\n#Person1#: There are problems with the audio, too. Some sections are no sound when the audio is cut. And when there is the audio, the volume isn't the same.\n#Person2#: That's true. I guess, he'll do better next time.
#Person1#: I'm pretty busy these days. I was given a new research project by the professor. He asked me to find research information about countries in Asia.\n#Person2#: Isn't it interesting?\n#Person1#: Yes, and there's much information I can get. But I was told to finish it in 3 days.\n#Person2#: What kind of information do you have to get?\n#Person1#: Mainly cultural customs, holidays and something like that.\n#Person2#: I'm pretty good at that kind of thing.\n#Person1#: Really? Then tell me how many languages are spoken in India.\n#Person2#: Uh...I think English and maybe a lot?\n#Person1#: And when was the Great Wall of China built?\n#Person2#: Sorry, I have no idea. Oh, I guess I can help you look it up on the Internet.
#Person1#: Hello. I want to send the computer to my sister in Shanghai by logistics transport.\n#Person2#: OK. Is it in the box? May I see it?\n#Person1#: Yes. This is the computer and this is the keyboard and the monitor.\n#Person2#: Is there anything else?\n#Person1#: There are a mouse and a camera.\n#Person2#: Is that all?\n#Person1#: Yes. How much is it to send these things to Shanghai by regular delivery?\n#Person2#: It depends on the weight of these things. Generally speaking, we will charge you ten yuan for one kilogram.\n#Person1#: I see. Can you weigh them for me, please?\n#Person2#: Please go over there to weigh them.\n#Person1#: OK. See you later.
#Person1#: What's wrong with you?\n#Person2#: I have a sore throat and headache.\n#Person1#: Do you feel tired?\n#Person2#: Yes, my whole body feels weak. And I really feel terrible.\n#Person1#: I'm sorry to hear that. I'll have to examine you.\n#Person2#: Ok, go ahead.\n#Person1#: Open your mouth and show me your tongue. Say ah... You have a bad cold. So you must stay in bed for a week.
#Person1#: Dave, there's something I want to talk to you about.\n#Person2#: Zina, why are you whispering?\n#Person1#: I've been talking to WebTracker. I'm thinking of jumping ship.\n#Person2#: What? Are you serious? You'd defect to our archrival! ?\n#Person1#: Keep your voice down. We'll talk more later. Right now I need to see Vince.\n#Person2#: We definitely have to talk, Zina. And watch your back. Elvin is still mad about his nose.\n#Person1#: OK, but don't tell anyone what I said.
#Person1#: Take a seat inside and see what you think. So you will take the Porsche then, sir?\n#Person2#: Yes, and I want to buy the insurance too. I think it's necessary.\n#Person1#: You're smart to buy it. At 45 dollars for three days, it is a good deal.\n#Person2#: Can I return the car in San Francisco?\n#Person1#: San Francisco? No, sir. We only have this office here. You will have to return it here.\n#Person2#: Really? I heard in America you can return rental cars in different cities.\n#Person1#: No, sir. That's only with the very big companies. I'm sorry, but this car must be returned to this lot.\n#Person2#: Well, I guess I will have to drive back down then. Hmm. I didn't think of that.\n#Person1#: Do you still want the car, sir?\n#Person2#: Yes. It will be fun. Driving back down the coast. My girlfriend will like it.\n#Person1#: It's a beautiful drive.\n#Person2#: Where are the keys?\n#Person1#: Just a moment, sir. We have to finish filling out the forms.
#Person1#: Wow! What a beautiful scenic spot! It's so open. And just breathe that fresh air, you can almost taste its freshness.\n#Person2#: You can have a bird view of Guiling City from the top of the mountain.\n#Person1#: Wonderful! I'll often come here for mountain climbing.\n#Person2#: You should. Many Guiliners, especially the old and the young, will climb mountains here in the morning.\n#Person1#: No wonder people say\n#Person2#: Quick! Pass me your binoculars. Look at that bird... I've never seen one of those before. It's indigenous to Guiling, and an endangered species too. This is lucky!\n#Person1#: I didn't know you liked bird-watching.\n#Person2#: I don't really. I just like wildlife, and you don't get to see too much of it in the city. This place is full of it.
#Person1#: Well, how did you enjoy your seaside trip?\n#Person2#: It was funny.\n#Person1#: Tell me about it, will you?\n#Person2#: Well, we drove through the valley on our way there in the morning. It was a magnificent sight.\n#Person1#: Did you stop at the big waterfall for pictures?\n#Person2#: Sure, we wouldn't miss it for anything. After that, we took a short cut to the park. There was very little traffic, so we got there in less than an hour.\n#Person1#: You were lucky then. What did you do after that?\n#Person2#: We went for a swim in the sea. That was the best part of the day. Just look at my nice tan.\n#Person1#: So you must have had a busy and enjoyable day yesterday.\n#Person2#: Yes, you're right. And I was so tired that I fell asleep on the way back. My arms are still stiff from the swim yesterday.
#Person1#: John, I'Ve asked you not to smoke in here! I don't want to see you smoking in my office again.\n#Person2#: I'm sorry, Ms. Fairbanks. I won't let it happen again.\n#Person1#: That's what you said the last time! If you want to smoke, you'll have to use your break time and go outside!\n#Person2#: I understand, Ms. Fairbanks.
#Person1#: Waitress, can I have the bill, please?\n#Person2#: Yes, sir. How would you like to pay the bill, sir?\n#Person1#: Do you accept credit cards?\n#Person2#: Yes, sir. But we only accept American Express, Master card and Visa. What kind do you have?\n#Person1#: Master card. Here you go.\n#Person2#: Wait a moment, please.
#Person1#: Okay, so let's go over everything one more time. I really want you to get this job!\n#Person2#: I know! It's an amazing growth opportunity! They're true industry leaders, and it would be so interesting to be part of an organization that is the undisputed leader in business process platform development.\n#Person1#: So, let's see, you did your research on the company, right?\n#Person2#: Well, I visited their website and read up on what they do. They're an IT service company that offers comprehensive business solutions for large corporations. They provide services such as ARM development, and they also offer customdesigned applications.\n#Person1#: So what would your role in the company?\n#Person2#: Well, the position is for an account manager. That basically means that I would be the link between our and our development team.\n#Person1#: Sounds good, and so, why do you want to work with them?\n#Person2#: Well, as I said they're the industry leaders, they have a really great growth strategy, amazing development opportunities for employees, and it seems like they have strong corporate governance. They're all about helping companies grow and unleashing potential. I guess their core values and mission really resonated with me. Oh, and they offer six weeks'vacation, stock options and bonuses. . . I'm totally going to cash in on that.\n#Person1#: You idiot! Don't say that! Do you want this job, or not?
#Person1#: And so, I just wanted to check in with you and find out where we are with this project. As you know, you'Ve missed a fairly significant deadline last week, and this will negativity impact the team's ability to move forward with the next stages of this project.\n#Person2#: I know, I'm really sorry that I missed the deadline. But really, it wasn't my fault. You see, we had all of these unexpected technical problems at the last minute, and that I couldn't get into the database and extract the kind of information that I needed for the data analysis. You know, if the tech guys would have done their job and kept the ARM stable, then I wouldn't have missed my deadline.\n#Person1#: Oh, come on! An excuse like that is tantamount to lying. You're essentially blaming the tech team for your time management issues, rather than accepting responsibility for the fact that you were procrastinating for the past two weeks.\n#Person2#: No, I'm not trying to pass the buck here ; I know that it was me who is ultimately responsible for getting this done. But the thing is, I could have finished on time if the system hadn't gone down. And you know, with everything I'Ve got going on now, I can't afford to waste time dealing with technical problems. I'Ve got a lot on my plate and there are only twenty-four hours in a day. . .\n#Person1#: I'm not going to accept this excuse. You're using these small technical glitches as a crutch and trying to rationalize the fact that you'Ve missed your deadline. Look, we have standards and I expect you to live up to those standards. No more phoney cases. If you're in over your head, you tell me. No more missed deadlines. Now, I want that data on my desk by nine am!
#Person1#: Hi, the lab said that you would be getting my test results in today.\n#Person2#: I like you to come in and discuss some further tests that I would like to run.\n#Person1#: I think that this is a bad sign.\n#Person2#: For now, I would like to run a few more tests to look into some of the problems that you mentioned.\n#Person1#: Why wouldn't you tell me over the phone?\n#Person2#: If there is any question about test results, we always do a recheck.\n#Person1#: I need to come in right away.\n#Person2#: I would be happy to see you this afternoon. If you are feeling upset, please bring a friend or relative along.\n#Person1#: You are scaring me!\n#Person2#: Come on in this afternoon and we will talk. It will be fine!
#Person1#: Ouch! The water's too hot!\n#Person2#: Get in slowly, sweetie. You'll get used to it. I'm gonna go and make you some chicken soup.\n#Person1#: I'm not hungry, Mom.\n#Person2#: I know you don't have an appetite, but you need to eat something. You'll get too weak if you don't eat.\n#Person1#: Oh. . . I'm sweating already. It's so hot. I can feel it boiling! Can I get out yet?\n#Person2#: That's a good sign. But just soak a little longer, OK?
#Person1#: Does Mr. Schmidt know he's going to become a father?\n#Person2#: No, and I have no way of getting ahold of him! There's no phone where he's at!\n#Person1#: Well, he has a surprise waiting for him when he gets back, doesn't he!\n#Person2#: My older sister Judy will be here soon to help. She already has a boy and a girl of her own. . .\n#Person1#: I just saw a red van pulling into the driveway. Is that her?
#Person1#: Excuse me.\n#Person2#: Yes, Miss, what can I do for you?\n#Person1#: I ordered my dish about a half an hour ago, but it hasn't arrived yet.\n#Person2#: I'm sorry for that, I'm going to check with the chef right now. Miss, I just checked with the kitchen, and they said your order will be coming right up next. Oh, here comes.\n#Person1#: Thank you.\n#Person2#: Miss, I'm very sorry for the delay, please enjoy this. Free a glass of wine for inconvenience. Again I'm terribly sorry to make you wait so long.\n#Person1#: It doesn't matter.
#Person1#: Come on in. I am so glad you are here. We have been expecting you.\n#Person2#: Am I late for the party? Looks everyone is already here. Hope I didn't miss something interesting.\n#Person1#: No, you are just on time. We haven't really started yet.\n#Person2#: Great, here are some flowers for you. I hope you like them. I was not sure if the color will suit your new apartment.\n#Person1#: Thank you, they're beautiful. You can hang your coat over there. Try this new couch, it is so comfortable. You will love it. Want something to drink, tea, coffee, juice or Cola?\n#Person2#: Don't bother. I will help myself.\n#Person1#: Make yourself at home.\n#Person2#: It is such a nice place.\n#Person1#: Well, I don't mean to boast but all the designs are done by myself and some colleagues are already trying to copy some of them for their new apartments. Look, they are making photos now of my designed kitchen.
#Person1#: You say he was around average height.\n#Person2#: Yes, that's right, around five nine five ten.\n#Person1#: Weight?\n#Person2#: I'm not sure. Medium I suppose. Maybe a little on the heavy side.\n#Person1#: Any marks on his face?\n#Person2#: No, I don't think so.\n#Person1#: Glasses?\n#Person2#: No.\n#Person1#: What about his hair?\n#Person2#: Black or dark brown.\n#Person1#: Long or short? Straight? Curly?\n#Person2#: Straight, I think, and about average length\n#Person1#: Boy, this sure doesn't help us much. It could be anybody. How about his cloth? What was he wearing?
#Person1#: Hey, Frank, there is that Janet Check.\n#Person2#: Wow, what a great burd!\n#Person1#: She sure knows how to strut her stuff.\n#Person2#: She's a real turn-on our rights.\n#Person1#: And look out she's dressed.\n#Person2#: Yeah, I noticed. She must be really loaded.\n#Person1#: No way. Her old man is rich. He buys her anything she wants.\n#Person2#: Lucky her. Anyway, I think that is just as beautiful.\n#Person1#: I think you've lost it.\n#Person2#: Well, that's my opinion.\n#Person1#: I admit that she is much prettier than Kate.\n#Person2#: Oh, there is no comparison. Now we are talking but ugly.\n#Person1#: At least we agree on that. Let's go and get a drink.
#Person1#: This place is so quiet and peaceful. It's really different from my pad at city.\n#Person2#: Sure, do you think you could live out here? You know, back to nature at all?\n#Person1#: I don't know. I don't mind coming out here for a while, but that will get old pretty soon.\n#Person2#: That's what I was thinking. I mean can you imagine Friday night instead of going out with your friends you'd have to stay in your tree house and talk to birds and squirrels.\n#Person1#: I think I'd go lonely if I do like that.\n#Person2#: And where would you get a cup of cappuccino?\n#Person1#: Now that would be hard to live without. We city folks are pretty spoiled.\n#Person2#: Maybe. But I ' d rather be spoiled than turn into a crazy guy with a long period to talk to the birds.
#Person1#: How old are you, Su?\n#Person2#: I am seven.\n#Person1#: I see, you have seven candles on the cake.\n#Person2#: Yes, I am seven. I am a big girl now.\n#Person1#: We will have a party here, right?\n#Person2#: Yes, come on, and we will have fun.
#Person1#: Excuse me, Miss.\n#Person2#: Yes. May I help you?\n#Person1#: I'm a graduate student here in mathematics. I've just come from China and I've never used a western library before. I'll be here for five years, so I'd like to learn to use the library as efficiently as possible. I wonder if someone might have time to show me around.\n#Person2#: I'd be very glad to show you around, but I'm very busy right now. Could you come back about 3 thirty?\n#Person1#: Sure. 3 thirty this afternoon.\n#Person2#: Good. See you later.\n#Person1#: Thank you. Good-bye.
#Person1#: Ten sheets of rice paper, 25 brushes, two boxes of oil color and two boxes of water color. All these come up to $ 35. 50, sir.\n#Person2#: Ok, here is $ 50. Oh, can you make out an invoice for me?\n#Person1#: Sure, just a minute. Are you an artist, sir?\n#Person2#: No, I am a teacher. I teach art.\n#Person1#: That must be a very interesting job.\n#Person2#: It is. You must be new here. I do my shopping here regularly, once a week.\n#Person1#: Do you? Nice to meet you! And here is the invoice and your change.\n#Person2#: Thank you. Nice to meet you, too.
#Person1#: How's the building work going?\n#Person2#: Well, I'm afraid we've had a slight delay.\n#Person1#: What's the problem? We really can't have any delays at this stage. We're working to a really tight schedule and we're already over budget.\n#Person2#: The cement arrived late but don't worry, I'm confident we can still meet the deadline. The crew is on stand-by and as soon as the concrete has set we can get started again.\n#Person1#: OK. Keep me informed. Jt must be ready on time.
#Person1#: Good afternoon madam. What can I do for you?\n#Person2#: Hi. I want to check out. My room is 1005.\n#Person1#: OK. Please hold on a minute. So you checked in on Monday and stayed 3 nights in single room 1005. Is that right?\n#Person2#: Yes. Can I have a look at my bill?\n#Person1#: OK. Here you are. If there are no questions, could we have your signature in the blank below?\n#Person2#: OK. I would like to have my receipt report, please.\n#Person1#: Here it is. We are pleased to serve you here and we look forward to seeing you again. Wish you have a good day.
#Person1#: Hello, Mr. Green. This is Lin Tong. How are you?\n#Person2#: Hi, Mr. Lin. I am leaving tomorrow and I am just packing.\n#Person1#: Oh, sorry to interrupt you. But I am calling to say goodbye to you. I am awfully sorry to tell you that I am afraid I could not see you off at the airport tomorrow, because I will have to attend a very important meeting.\n#Person2#: It doesn't matter, Mr. Lin. I can understand. I know you are always very busy. Work must come first.\n#Person1#: Thanks a lot. You have been here for almost three weeks. How time flies!\n#Person2#: Yes. And I would like to convey my thanks to you for your help during my stay here in Nanjing.\n#Person1#: It is our pleasure. It has been a great pleasure to work with you.\n#Person2#: Me too.

#Person1#: Albert? Could you co-sign this approval sheet? Accounting's getting really picky.\n#Person2#: I know. They'Ve already sent back two approvals I sent them. Where do I sign?\n#Person1#: Right here. It's for that new fax machine we're getting.\n#Person2#: Oh, right. I remember. There you are. Hope you don't have as many problems as I had!
#Person1#: Where can I find information on this subject?\n#Person2#: I'm not sure. Let's look up the catalogue.\n#Person1#: Will you give some advice on this experiment?\n#Person2#: I advise that step be taken in power supply first.\n#Person1#: What's his suggestion for this work?\n#Person2#: His suggestion is that the work be started at once.\n#Person1#: The way I see it is that they'd join us.\n#Person2#: I think so too.
#Person1#: Linda, this is Todd calling.\n#Person2#: Todd, I am so happy you called!\n#Person1#: Linda, I wanted to tell you how much I enjoyed our time together last Friday night.\n#Person2#: Boy, Todd, that was one great movie you picked out! Thanks for asking me to go with you!\n#Person1#: I had a great time too and was thinking that maybe you might want to join me for a hike to the waterfalls on Saturday.\n#Person2#: A hike would be great! Let me pack us a nice picnic lunch, OK?\n#Person1#: Linda, that would be a perfect addition.\n#Person2#: I'll take care of the lunch then, and you can take care of the other plans. What time would you like to pick me up?\n#Person1#: I was hoping to leave by 9 o'clock so that it won 't be too hot for the hike.\n#Person2#: Nine is a great time to get started. I'll see you on Saturday!
#Person1#: What is your policy on returns?\n#Person2#: If you bring them back with your receipt within seven days, you'll get a full refund. Also, if you need alterations to the pants, just bring them in and we'll do them for free.\n#Person1#: Sounds good.\n#Person2#: That'll be $ 70, please. Will you be paying by cash or charge?\n#Person1#: Charge. Here's my card.\n#Person2#: Okay, sir, here you are. Thank you very much.\n#Person1#: Thank you.
#Person1#: What's for dinner tonight?\n#Person2#: It's whatever you're planning on cooking.\n#Person1#: You're not going to cook?\n#Person2#: No, I always cook.\n#Person1#: Yeah, and I love your cooking.\n#Person2#: Don't give me that. If you're hungry, then cook dinner.\n#Person1#: You're being serious?\n#Person2#: Look, I'm really tired tonight. I don't feel like cooking dinner.\n#Person1#: Okay, I'll make dinner tonight.\n#Person2#: Thank you. I'm going to bed.\n#Person1#: Do you want me to wake you up when dinner is ready?\n#Person2#: Yes, please.
#Person1#: do you have any plans for tomorrow night?\n#Person2#: not really. I wasn thinking of maybe going to a movie. Do you want to go with me?\n#Person1#: sure. What movies were you thinking about going to?\n#Person2#: have you heard of Hot Fuzz?\n#Person1#: yes. Isn't the director of that movie the same guy who directed Shaun of the Dead?\n#Person2#: that's the one. It's an actioncomedy. What do you think?\n#Person1#: to be honest, I didn't really like Shaun of the Dead. Besides, I like movies with a happy ending best.\n#Person2#: what do you have in mind?\n#Person1#: I was thinking of seeing You, Me and Dupree. It's a typical Hollywood blockbuster.\n#Person2#: isn't that the chick flick with Kate Hudson and Owen Wilson?\n#Person1#: yeah, I suppose you wouldn't want to see that, huh?\n#Person2#: not really. Do you like biographical / drama films?\n#Person1#: It depends on who the film is about. Which movie did you have in mind?\n#Person2#: Anne Hathaway is in a new movie called Becoming Jane which is based on a true story about Jane Austen.\n#Person1#: that sounds fantastic! What time is it playing?\n#Person2#: it's on at 8: 00 pm at the Phoenix Theatres. I have a membership there, so I can book the tickets ahead of time.\n#Person1#: great. Shall I meet you there around 7:45 tomorrow night?\n#Person2#: sounds good. I'll see you then!
#Person1#: Hello. 138-2369.\n#Person2#: Hello. Is Anna there?\n#Person1#: No. I'm sorry Anna is out.\n#Person2#: Oh, well, could you please leave Anna a message for me?\n#Person1#: Sure. What is it?\n#Person2#: You know, Anna is coming for tea at my home. Would you ask her to see if she has my French dictionary? If she does, tell her to bring it with her.\n#Person1#: All right. And where are you calling from?\n#Person2#: 136, Rose Street. I'm Anna's friend Jenny.
#Person1#: What changes do you think will take place in the next 50 years?\n#Person2#: I imagine that the greatest change will be the difference between humans and machines.\n#Person1#: What do you mean?\n#Person2#: I mean it will be harder to tell the difference between the human and the machine.\n#Person1#: Can you describe it more clearly?\n#Person2#: As science develops, it will be possible for all parts of one's body to be replaced. A computer will work like the human brain. The computer can recognize one's feelings, and act in a feeling way.\n#Person1#: You mean man-made human beings will be produced? Come on! That's out of the question!\n#Person2#: Don't get excited, please. That's only my personal imagination!\n#Person1#: Go on, please. I won't take it seriously.\n#Person2#: We will then be able to create a machine that is a copy of ourselves. We'll appear to be alive long after we are dead.\n#Person1#: What a ridiculous idea!\n#Person2#: It's possible that a way will be found to put our spirit into a new body. Then, we can choose to live as long as we want.\n#Person1#: In that case, the world would be a hopeless mess!
#Person1#: Hello, Yang Mei. I hear you're going to the United States.\n#Person2#: Yes. I'm going with my grandma. We're going to see my parents in New Jersey.\n#Person1#: When are you leaving, then?\n#Person2#: This Friday evening. Our plane leaves at seven fifteen.\n#Person1#: How long will you be there?\n#Person2#: Six months.\n#Person1#: Six months! Do you go and see my grandparents in New York?\n#Person2#: Of course, I will. I want to see as many places as I can. How can I travel?\n#Person1#: Most people travel by car. The roads are very good.\n#Person2#: But I don't have a car and I can't drive. Is there any other way to travel?\n#Person1#: You can travel by bus. It's very cheap.\n#Person2#: Can't I travel by train?\n#Person1#: Yes, you can. The train is expensive in the States, but it's fast.\n#Person2#: Thank you very much. Well, must be off now. See you when I get back.\n#Person1#: Good luck and have a good trip!

What about this pair?\n#Person2#: Sorry, I don't like white. Have you got any other colors?\n#Person1#: Oh, yes. We have also got blue, brown and black.\n#Person2#: Can I have a look at the black ones? Black is my favourite colour.\n#Person1#: Sure. Here you are.\n#Person2#: They look nice.

Are you feeling ill?\n#Person2#: No. I'm only sleepy because I stayed awake the whole night.\n#Person1#: Breakfast is ready. Get dressed and get out of bed. Don't forget to wash you face and brush your teeth before you eat breakfast.\n#Person2#: OK, I'm coming.
#Person1#: Hello, Lucy. This is Mac. How are you?\n#Person2#: Fine, thank you. A bit too busy, though, you know, I'm trying to put everything in order in mynew apartment.\n#Person1#: Oh, I see. Well, I was wondering if you'd like to go to a concert tomorrow evening. I think it'll begood. And if I remember correctly, you did say you like pop music.\n#Person2#: Yes, that's right. I do. It's nice of you to ask me, Mac. But I don't think I can. Margaret has already asked me to see a friend and then we'll go tothe cinema together. In fact, she's getting the tickets this evening.\n#Person1#: Oh, well. Never mind. What about next weekend? This concert is still on then, I think, if you're free next Saturday.\n#Person2#: Oh, I'd like to very much, but what time exactly?\n#Person1#: Well, it starts at 7:00 P.m., I think.\n#Person2#: Oh, good, that'll be fine. The basketball match will be over by 5:30, I'm sure.\n#Person1#: Good, I'll call you again when I get the tickets.\n#Person2#: Sure. Bye for now.
#Person1#: Excuse me. I'd like to find out about flights to New York.\n#Person2#: Well, let's see. One just left about five minutes ago; and there's another one at ten.\n#Person1#: What time is it, please?\n#Person2#: It's five to eight.\n#Person1#: So the plane leaves in about two hours.\n#Person2#: That's right. Have you bought your ticket?\n#Person1#: No, I haven't, Can I buy one here?\n#Person2#: I'm afraid you can't. You'd better go to the hooking office.
#Person1#: Hi, Susan. How are you? I've been wondering when I'd run into you. What are you busy with?\n#Person2#: Nice to meet you here, Tim. I'm buying some Christmas gifts for those who work with me, but it's really a headache.\n#Person1#: Maybe I could give you some advice. Firstly, you'd better divide them into different groups-who were the people that are your friends as well as your workmates and who are the people you do not know well but you see pretty much daily.\n#Person2#: OK, then what should I do?\n#Person1#: For the friends, you want to get them personal gift. Do they like chocolate?\n#Person2#: This is what I always give, but I know Mary is on a diet.\n#Person1#: Does she like fruit or coffee? Anyway, think of the gift that you know your friend likes.\n#Person2#: Well, I think fruit is helpful to keep fit. What about the rest of them?\n#Person1#: Leave cards in their mailboxes or on their desks.\n#Person2#: Christmas cards?\n#Person1#: Yes, you can afford that. More importantly, it's true of them that you're thinking of them.\n#Person2#: Thank you for your suggestion, Tim. You really have saved me and my money as well.
#Person1#: Hi, Jack. Who are you writing to?\n#Person2#: I'm writing to my parents telling them I'll stay here this summer.\n#Person1#: You're not going home? I thought you were going on a trip to Japan with your family.\n#Person2#: Well, I intended to go with them, but I thought again and changed my mind.\n#Person1#: Tell me. I'm interested in knowing what keeps you from joining your beloved family and staying here. It certainly is not studying.\n#Person2#: No, certainly not. Michael arranged for me to work at his uncle's institution.\n#Person1#: How much will you be paid?\n#Person2#: Judy, I don't do it for money, but for experience. Besides, it's voluntary work.\n#Person1#: You work without payment? That's really something.\n#Person2#: When will you leave for home?\n#Person1#: Tomorrow. We'll fly to Hawaii two days after. I really have to pack now.\n#Person2#: Go then. Have a nice vacation!\n#Person1#: I'll send you postcards.
#Person1#: Do you think discrimination against women in the work force is still prevalent even today? \n#Person2#: From my own experience as a career woman, I would have to say that while things are getting better now than they used to be, it is still a widespread problem. Society is changing, but there is still a glass ceiling for women in many career tracks. \n#Person1#: dDo you think the glass ceiling phenomena is because of traditional social customs? Or are there more issues coming into play? \n#Person2#: I think it's a very complicated issue. A part of the difficulties women have advancing in the work force are due to few opportunities and many male managers. Don't underestimate the good ole' boy system. Men have power, so it's easier for them to stay in power. \n#Person1#: What about affirmative action? Hasn't legislation changed a lot of the make hierarchy? \n#Person2#: Affirmative action has given us management quotas and bans sexual discrimination, but it's still a man's world. 
#Person1#: Do you want to sign for a Korea language class? \n#Person2#: What for? Oh, I see, you mean next year our company will expand business to the South Korea market. \n#Person1#: Right, we have located a business partner in Seoul. The first contact proves to be successful. The general manager of South Korean company has scheduled to pay a visit to us next month. I think it is quite possible to set up a joint venture company with them soon. \n#Person2#: Well, sounds promising. But I think our company will provide us with the language training courses if it is necessary. We need not bother signing for the language by ourselves. \n#Person1#: A slow sparrow should make an early start. You know, I am not quick at learning any language. 
#Person1#: I'd appreciate it if you could help me pick out a gift for my daughter. \n#Person2#: Would she be interested in a laptop? \n#Person1#: That's exactly what I was thinking of. \n#Person2#: A Mac would be an excellent gift. \n#Person1#: I like Macs. How much for a Mac? \n#Person2#: You can take a 15-inch Pro home right now for only $2, 100. \n#Person1#: A Mac it is. I'll take one home with me. \n#Person2#: She'll be very happy with this. And how do you plan to pay for it? \n#Person1#: I'll use my VISA, if that's okay. \n#Person2#: Now, if you'll just sign here, the Mac is all yours. \n#Person1#: Will she need anything besides what's in this box? \n#Person2#: Everything she needs is right here in the box. \n#Person1#: I appreciate your help. Maybe I'll be back for more computer stuff. \n#Person2#: Your daughter should get straight A's from now on. Good-bye. 
#Person1#: I think he won't remember White Day . \n#Person2#: Silly , you should make sure he does . \n#Person1#: Uh-huh. How about you ? \n#Person2#: He's buying me a handbag, and then dinner at a gorgeous restaurant. \n#Person1#: You got a big return for a small gift. 
#Person1#: So what kind of job did you find for this summer?\n#Person2#: I'm working for a marketing company. I'm doing telephone marketing.\n#Person1#: Oh, so you are one of those people who drive me crazy by calling me up in trying to persuade me to buy something that I have no need for. Do you like it?\n#Person2#: Believe it or not, I do. There are a lot of students working there and we have a lot of fun when we're not making calls. It's really easy since we just have to read from a text.\n#Person1#: Are you doing this full time?\n#Person2#: Yeah, but I work from 2:00 in the afternoon until 11:00 at night so I can sleep as late as I want to in the morning.
#Person1#: Hello, Sunshine Flower Shop. This is Shareen speaking.\n#Person2#: This is Tom Hanks. I'd like to order some flowers for my mother and have them sent to her apartment.\n#Person1#: Fine, Mr. Hanks. What kind of flowers do you want?\n#Person2#: I'd like to send a dozen red carnations.\n#Person1#: A dozen red carnations? Our long stem red carnations are selling for 12 pounds a dozen this weekend. They are really quite nice.\n#Person2#: Alright then, I'll take those.\n#Person1#: I need your complete address, Mr. Hanks.\n#Person2#: The address is number 84 MW Street. For the card, just write something simple. How about 'dear mom, all my love, Tom'?\n#Person1#: Of course. OK, when should they arrive?\n#Person2#: They should be there before 5 o'clock in the afternoon on June seventeenth. My mom's telephone number is 8456086363. Please call her first before you deliver them.\n#Person1#: That should be no problem. Just one more question, Mr. Hanks. How do you intend to pay for it?\n#Person2#: You can put it on my visa card. The number is KH 3272645.\n#Person1#: Got it. Bye.\n#Person2#: Bye, thanks.
#Person1#: Well, I think my article can't be more awful.\n#Person2#: Not likely. Why are you so unconfident about your paper?\n#Person1#: You know, I missed the deadline for handing in the paper. So I'm uncertain about the content of my paper.\n#Person2#: Take it easy. Actually, I read your article last night and I found that you had applied the general knowledge to specific problems in your article.\n#Person1#: You think so? You mean I have done well?\n#Person2#: Yeah, your work is not bad. However, I have some suggestions for you. Keep to the point, but cross out the unimportant information carefully, or that may have caused some mistakes.\n#Person1#: OK, thanks.
#Person1#: I've read a report on the people who can use the foreign language, mainly English.\n#Person2#: Really? What's it about?\n#Person1#: It's mainly about different attitudes people have towards the foreign language learning. About 27% of the people think a foreign language is a must in their daily life.\n#Person2#: I can't agree more. There're more and more people learning foreign languages.\n#Person1#: That's ture. About 35% of the people at learning are willing to learn the foreign language.\n#Person2#: As far as I'm concerned, many people especially students are forced to do so because of exams.\n#Person1#: Yes, that accounts for twenty one percent. There are also about 15% of the people who take a foreign language to be useless and they take no interest in them at all.
#Person1#: Why do you have an umbrella with you? It's not supposed to rain today, is it?\n#Person2#: No, but it's supposed to be very hot. I'll use this umbrella to protect myself from the sun as soon as these clouds go away.\n#Person1#: I've never heard of using an umbrella for protection from the sun.\n#Person2#: Did you know that the Chinese invented the umbrella, and that it's first use was for protection against the sun, not the rain?\n#Person1#: I had no idea, you must get sunburned easily, huh?\n#Person2#: Oh, absolutely. I always get super red if I haven't put on sun cream.
#Person1#: Hello, is this the hotel service center?\n#Person2#: Yes, it is. What can I help you with, sir?\n#Person1#: It's me and my daughter. We're stuck in the elevator.\n#Person2#: Heavens! Don't worry, sir. I'll call the Fire Department and our mechanics to help you get out of there ASAP.\n#Person1#: So what should I do now? Just wait here?\n#Person2#: Yes, sir. And please do not touch any button in the elevator except for the phone.\n#Person1#: All right. But just make it quick, OK? I'm fine though. But my little girl, she is completely freaked out in suffering a lot. I'm not sure how long she can hold up?
#Person1#: Good morning, ma'am. Are you being helped?\n#Person2#: No, I'm not. I'm here to look for a winter coat.\n#Person1#: I can certainly help you with that. How about this one? It's made of very high quality wool.\n#Person2#: It's nice, but I actually need something warmer. This would work if I were staying here in Los Angeles, but it's too light for a Chicago winter.\n#Person1#: Ah, you need a very heavy coat then. Please follow me. look at this one. It is our warmest coat and it is also fashionable and very comfortable.\n#Person2#: Would it be possible to get a discount on it?\n#Person1#: Maybe we can give you a 5% discount.\n#Person2#: OK. I'll take it.\n#Person1#: Can I interest you in some gloves? There are 10% off now.\n#Person2#: No, thanks. I used to live in Connecticut, so I already have some.
#Person1#: Have you decided where to go for the vacation?\n#Person2#: I will join John in his mountaineering trip.\n#Person1#: Woo cool. Which mountain are you going to conquer?\n#Person2#: We haven't made up our minds. Will you come with us?\n#Person1#: Of course, I will.
#Person1#: It's too hot to read.\n#Person2#: We'd better go out for a walk.\n#Person1#: Which season do you like best?\n#Person2#: Spring.\n#Person1#: How about summer?\n#Person2#: I dislike it most.\n#Person1#: Why?\n#Person2#: Because the hottest season is summer in a year.\n#Person1#: But sometimes summer is more charming than the other seasons.
#Person1#: Broadway Mall is having a big sale this weekend. You wanna go?\n#Person2#: Don't feel like it. I'm broke.\n#Person1#: Well, we can still do some window shopping, can't we?\n#Person2#: Just look around? Ah, that's boring.\n#Person1#: I'll go myself then.
#Person1#: Hey, John! I haven't seen you in ages! What's new? What have you been up to?\n#Person2#: Pete!

What are you trading?\n#Person2#: Currencies.\n#Person1#: Currencies? As in Euros, Dollars, Pounds and Rupees?\n#Person2#: It's called Forex. Foreign Exchange. The great thing about it is that I don't have to invest a huge amount. I put in a margin deposit and then I can buy and sell up to 100 times that much!\n#Person1#: I don't understand. You're buying and selling money?\n#Person2#: You got it! Just last night I made USD 150!\n#Person1#: Last night?\n#Person2#: Yeah! It's a 24 hour market! I had bought some RMB earlier at a low asking price but last night it appreciated drastically so I made a split second decision and sold all my RMB at an amazing bid! I'\n#Person1#: You're kidding! I'm on! Where do I sign up?
#Person1#: What do you want to know about me?\n#Person2#: How about your academic records at college?\n#Person1#: The average grade of all my courses is above 85.\n#Person2#: In which subject did you get the highest marks?\n#Person1#: In mathematics I got a 98.\n#Person2#: Have you received any scholarships?\n#Person1#: Yes, I have, and three times in total.\n#Person2#: Have you been a class leader?\n#Person1#: I have been a class commissary in charge of studies for two years.\n#Person2#: Did you join in any club activities?\n#Person1#: I was an aerobics team member in college.\n#Person2#: What sport are you good at?\n#Person1#: I am good at sprint and table tennis.\n#Person2#: You are excellent.
#Person1#: What a lovely day, isn't it?\n#Person2#: Yes, it's nice and bright.\n#Person1#: I hope it stays like this.\n#Person2#: I hope so too.\n#Person1#: Is the weather usually like this here?\n#Person2#: It's usually a bit hotter than today.\n#Person1#: What's the weather like in winter?\n#Person2#: It's pretty cold and it often snows.\n#Person1#: I wonder what it's going to be like tomorrow.\n#Person2#: Let's hear the weather report later. What's the weather like in your hometown?\n#Person1#: Neither too cold, nor too hot.\n#Person2#: That's quite a lovely weather.\n#Person1#: Yes, especially in spring.\n#Person2#: Have you ever seen a hurricane?\n#Person1#: Once, when I was a child.\n#Person2#: Do they often happen in your country?\n#Person1#: Now and then.\n#Person2#: Oh, it's time for the weather reporter. Let's turn on the TV.
#Person1#: I can't believe the cost of apartments in New York City.\n#Person2#: Oh, you didn't know that apartments here are considered valuable, even if they are small and crowded?\n#Person1#: Of course I had heard about that, but now I know how expensive it is to rent a place here.\n#Person2#: I don't mind paying high rent to live in New York.\n#Person1#: Why? You pay so much for such a tiny space to live.\n#Person2#: Yeah, but so what! I'm proud to live in the world's most exciting city. And, the salaries here are the highest in the nation, too.
#Person1#: Mr. Rogers?\n#Person2#: Mr. : Yes?\n#Person1#: I'm not feeling too well.\n#Person2#: Mr. : Would you like to go to the nurse's?\n#Person1#: Yes, I would.\n#Person2#: Mr. : Here's a hall pass for it. Do you need someone to walk you there?\n#Person1#: I can manage on my own. Thanks.\n#Person2#: Mr. : I'll drop by later to check on you.
#Person1#: I like NBA very much.\n#Person2#: Did you watch NBA games before you came to the U. S. ?\n#Person1#: No, I didn't.\n#Person2#: What a pity!\n#Person1#: Do you like NBA?\n#Person2#: Yes, of course.\n#Person1#: Who do you like best of the NBA players?\n#Person2#: Kobe.\n#Person1#: So do I.\n#Person2#: Let's go to watch an NBA game tonight, shall we?\n#Person1#: That's fine.
#Person1#: Hi, Kate.\n#Person2#: Hi, Don. What a surprise!\n#Person1#: Yeah, I saw someone walking like you, but I wasn't sure. We haven't seen each other for how long? Almost three months? But you look quite different now.\n#Person2#: Have you noticed what has changed?\n#Person1#: Oh, you look quite slender and more vivacious. What have you been taking? Are you on a diet?\n#Person2#: Yes. I'm on a diet, but I'Ve not taken anything. I just eat less and exercise more. And it really worked in the past three months. I'Ve lost twelve pounds.\n#Person1#: Wow! That's great. I sincerely want to achieve my weight loss goals, but it's difficult for me to keep up the exercise. Also you know, old habits are hard to break.\n#Person2#: What kind of exercise do you think I do? I just go to dance everyday after work. I'm taking an amateur dance class. I dance two hours everyday.\n#Person1#: Dance? You only go dancing? That's not hard. I can do that.\n#Person2#: Sure. Join my class next week.
#Person1#: Mom, you know that Andrea and I sometimes worry about you.\n#Person2#: Really? Why would you worry about me? I'm just fine.\n#Person1#: You're almost 70 years old, Mom! Don't you think it would be better for you if you moved in with us?\n#Person2#: No way! I like my apartment, and I like to be independent.\n#Person1#: Do you ever get lonely living alone?\n#Person2#: Not at all. I see you and your family twice a week, and I enjoy seeing my own friends. I'm too busy to feel lonely!
#Person1#: Hey, Wen! Welcome to D. C. ! Glad you came out to visit!\n#Person2#: Thanks for inviting me. Actually, I've never been anywhere with so many black people before. It's different.\n#Person1#: Howard is eighty percent black. But there are whites, and even Asians here. Thankfully, it's also coed.\n#Person2#: Great! Is your, too?\n#Person1#: Sorry, nope. But the Alpha Phi Alpha's are throwing a party tonight.\n#Person2#: That's a black fraternity, right? So we should see some dancing!
#Person1#: Hi, my name is Ted, what's yours?\n#Person2#: What?\n#Person1#: I said, I'm Ted, who are you?\n#Person2#: Huh? Oh, my name is Laura.\n#Person1#: Do you somewhere often, Laura?\n#Person2#: Huh? I can't hear you, the music's too loud.\n#Person1#: Let's go outside and talk. So Laura, do you come here often?\n#Person2#: Hold on, my ears are still ringing from the music. . . what was it you asked me?\n#Person1#: I asked if you come here often.\n#Person2#: Sometimes, usually once every few weeks. Do you?\n#Person1#: No, this is my first time here.\n#Person2#: I usually come with a group of friends. We dance a little, have a few drinks, and just have a good time.\n#Person1#: Yeah, that's why I'm here. My friends dragged me here, because they think I spend too much time studying.\n#Person2#: That's good. It's good to hit the books, but you need to get out once in a while.\n#Person1#: I guess so. But the music is too loud. I don't mind getting out and meeting people, but next time I'll do it in a park.
#Person1#: Good morning, Miss.\n#Person2#: Morning. Can I help you?\n#Person1#: Yes, I'd like to know how to use the library. You know, I'm a new student here.\n#Person2#: All you need is your student identification card to check out books.\n#Person1#: Yes. Here's my identification.\n#Person2#: That's all you need.\n#Person1#: Thank you very much. By the way, how many books am I allowed to check out?\n#Person2#: You can check out two books at a time. But you can't check out newspapers, magazines and periodicals, they have to be read within library.\n#Person1#: How long can I keep the books?\n#Person2#: For two weeks. After that you must renew the book if you wish to keep them longer.\n#Person1#: I want a book on physics. Could you show me where I can find it?\n#Person2#: Yes, over there to your left.
#Person1#: Albert and I need a lot of things to furnish our house. But I don't know where the best place to shop is. Can you give me some advice?\n#Person2#: Sure, Carolyn. I'm happy to help you. What kinds of things do you need right now?\n#Person1#: Well, we have most of the furniture already. We mostly need kitchen utensils, bathroom accessories, cleaning and laundry accessories--things like that. And Albert wants to set up a little off\n#Person2#: Well, as for Albert, he should go to an office supply store. There's a very good one called Office Depot. They have everything he will need. And their prices are good too. It's very convey\n#Person1#: Can I write that down?\n#Person2#: Sure, it's spelled Office and then D - E - P - O - T. It's in the Yellow Pages.\n#Person1#: Thanks.\n#Person2#: And as for the kitchen things, do you want very high quality?\n#Person1#: What do you mean?\n#Person2#: I mean, do you want the best quality, or do you want good prices?\n#Person1#: Probably good prices. You know we will only be in America for about a year.\n#Person2#: Then I suggest you go to K-Mart or Wal-Mart.\n#Person1#: What are those stores?\n#Person2#: They are very large, discount department stores. That means their prices are very good. And you can find everything you need for the kitchen or bathroom.\n#Person1#: Even silverware?\n#Person2#: Yes, everything. They don't have the most expensive brands, but their quality is usually decent. The main thing is, they have good prices, and they are very convenient.\n#Person1#: I have a friend that said something about a place called Price Club. Do you know about that?\n#Person2#: I have never shopped there, but I think Price Club is a kind of membership store.\n#Person1#: What does that mean?\n#Person2#: That means you have to pay a membership fee to shop there. I have heard they have very good prices on electronics.\n#Person1#: Electronics?\n#Person2#: Yes. Like stereos and televisions.\n#Person1#: How much is the membership fee?\n#Person2#: I'm not sure. But if you are only going to stay a year, I don't think Price Club is good to join. They have great deals occasionally. They are very good for people who like to buy new things all\n#Person1#: I see. Thanks for these tips. We really need to buy a lot of little things.\n#Person2#: I know how it is. Moving is very troublesome.
#Person1#: Good morning and welcome. How can I help you?\n#Person2#: Could you tell me something about safety deposit box rental, please? I need somewhere safe to keep some insurance documents ; I just simply don't feel comfortable keeping them at home or in the office.\n#Person1#: We have 3 different types of boxes. We usually rent for 1 year and the fee depends on the size and location of the box.\n#Person2#: I think I'll go for the smallest, as it's just for documents. Will I be the only key holder? I'd perhaps feel a little nervous if I knew someone else could have access to it at any time.\n#Person1#: You can have more than 1 key if you'd like, but we must have signature cards for each box.\n#Person2#: That's great ; I can give an extra key to my wife. I feel perfectly comfortable with her having a key. Thanks for your help.\n#Person1#: If you have your ID and are willing to pay a year in advance, we can do that for you today, there is no need to wait.\n#Person2#: OK, I'll take a small, for 1 year, in this branch, please.
#Person1#: Why not go to the supermarket today, the coupon will be past due in three days.\n#Person2#: Sure. Can we use it in Today Supermarket?\n#Person1#: Let me check. Yes, we can.\n#Person2#: I really don't know what to buy.
#Person1#: Help! Help!\n#Person2#: What's the trouble, ma'am?\n#Person1#: I was taking a walk when a young man came at me from nowhere and snatched the bag off my hands and ran away.\n#Person2#: What did the young man look like?\n#Person1#: Well, he's young, tall and thin.\n#Person2#: To which direction did he run?\n#Person1#: Let me see. . . my right arm. . . oh, to the east.
#Person1#: What else should we do now after the floors are done and after the furniture is in?\n#Person2#: We need to redo the curtains and paint all the walls and ceilings.\n#Person1#: I'm the painter. You can be in charge of going to curtain shops to choose curtains. That will probably be pretty expensive too. Having good curtains made isn't cheap.\n#Person2#: You mean we can't just buy curtains already made?\n#Person1#: Absolutely not. The windows must be measured, and then the curtains need to be made professionally. So that will take a while. Maybe a month or so.\n#Person2#: While the curtains are being made, I can start having people look at the kitchen. I can't stand that old kitchen. I won't be able to cook there. I don't want to use that electric stove.\n#Person1#: We need to find an interior decorating company to redecorate the kitchen. I believe in Portland there are shops that specialize in kitchen renovation. I will look in the Yellow Pages. I'd like a kitchen mostly in ivory and light green.\n#Person2#: I agree. The colors must be soft and pleasant. You should feel comfortable when you cook our dinners.\n#Person1#: Me? Cook our dinners? Hah! You will be cooking, dear. You will cook.\n#Person2#: No, I don't think so. I'll be too busy having tea in our new tea room.\n#Person1#: Well, I suppose we'll have to hire a cook then. So you won't be able to afford any clothes next year.\n#Person2#: And you'll have to sell your motorcycle. And your cameras. Right?\n#Person1#: Maybe I'll cook once or twice a week. How is that?\n#Person2#: Four times might be enough. Not once or twice.
#Person1#: Do you have some good ideas of losing weight?\n#Person2#: First of all, you should pay attention to what you eat. Don't eat too much food with high calories, such as chocolate, ice cream and the like.\n#Person1#: Any more?\n#Person2#: Stay away from fried foods. Fried foods are fried in oil or fat.\n#Person1#: Got it.\n#Person2#: Do not be a couch potato. You should do more exercise.\n#Person1#: Well, it seems that I should do some jogging from tomorrow on.
#Person1#: Hello, I want to order an Easy-own package. What would you recommend?\n#Person2#: Which function do you use more, making calls or sending short messages?\n#Person1#: About the same. But I'm looking for a job, so I have to answer the phone often.\n#Person2#: Then I recommend this package to you. You can receive all the calls free by paying just 10 yuan a month.\n#Person1#: That's good. How can I order it?\n#Person2#: Sending a message'KTCTWY'to 10086 will do.\n#Person1#: Thank you. I'll have a try.\n#Person2#: You're welcome.
#Person1#: Could you tell me something about your previous job?\n#Person2#: Yes. I worked in a small machinery factory. My work was very simple and there was not much work to do.\n#Person1#: Didn't you like it?\n#Person2#: No, I thought it was too dull. I'm capable of more responsibilities, so I decided to change my job.\n#Person1#: Why do you choose our company?\n#Person2#: Yesterday I saw your company's advertisement. Your company is an important international company. Working for it, I believe it can improve my abilities.\n#Person1#: What do you know about our company?\n#Person2#: Oh, the company is the fourth largest machine producer in the world. It was founded in the United States in 1980. I know that the company has made good use of advanced technology.
#Person1#: How about your study at college?\n#Person2#: I was doing quite well at college. I completed my MBA degree in international trade with first-class honors.\n#Person1#: Why did you select your college?\n#Person2#: I selected my college because it had an excellent academic reputation.\n#Person1#: What do you like doing in your spare time?\n#Person2#: My favorite recreation is cooking. I learned to cook Chinese dishes and western style dishes as well. It keeps me busy and makes me happy.
#Person1#: What kind of job are you interested in?\n#Person2#: I want a job in which I can use English, I would also like to be able to have some responsibility in my work.\n#Person1#: I really appreciate that I would expect my secretary to be able to work independently and take over some of my ordinary responsibilities, such as answering routine correspondence, taking phone calls for me and sometimes assisting me with personal affairs.\n#Person2#: Yes, I see. In my previous job, I did typing and filing everyday.\n#Person1#: Have you had any experience as a guide?\n#Person2#: Well, not exactly, but I have shown some of my foreign friends around Beijing.\n#Person1#: Once in a while we have visitors from abroad and I would like to be able to ask my secretary to take them shopping and sightseeing.\n#Person2#: I think I would like that.
#Person1#: What are you doing this weekend?\n#Person2#: My brother-in-law is having a small get-together at his house and he invited me.\n#Person1#: Is it a family thing or just friends?\n#Person2#: A bit of both. Some cousins, aunts and uncles will be there, but also some friends from the neighborhood.\n#Person1#: Is your great uncle Rick going to be there? He is really funny.\n#Person2#: Yeah he is going to be there with his step-son and his ex-wife.\n#Person1#: You mean your sister?\n#Person2#: No, Rick is actually my great uncle, so he is my grandmother's brother.\n#Person1#: You lost me.\n#Person2#: I'll explain later, let's go.
#Person1#: Good morning. I'm Mickey Huang, I have an appointment with Mr. wilson.\n#Person2#: Is this about the Sales Assistant position?\n#Person1#: That's right. My appointment is for 11 o'clock.\n#Person2#: Mr. wilson is on the line right now. Please have a seat. He'll be right with you.\n#Person1#: Thank you.\n#Person2#: Can I get you something, coffee, tea?\n#Person1#: No, I'm fine. Thank you.
#Person1#: You'v been work here for nearly a month, how do you feel about the job?\n#Person2#: Not bad. Thank you for your help. I am always busy with this job, I feel a bit tired.\n#Person1#: I had the same feeling when I first came to work here. but after a period of time, I feel better, I am sure you'll get used to this busy job.\n#Person2#: I also feel that work efficiency here is very high. and you have strong working ability and professional skill, it seems that you know all, that's really wonderful!\n#Person1#: You know the phrase, the survival the fittest. We have no choices.\n#Person2#: That's right, I have to work hard.
#Person1#: How may I help you?\n#Person2#: I need to check these books out.\n#Person1#: Do you have your library card?\n#Person2#: Here it is.\n#Person1#: It appears that you have late fees.\n#Person2#: Really?\n#Person1#: Yes, really.\n#Person2#: How much do I owe?\n#Person1#: You owe $ 24. 50 in late fees.\n#Person2#: I don't have that much today.\n#Person1#: I'm sorry, but until you pay it, you won't be able to check out any more books.\n#Person2#: I'll pay it as soon as possible.
#Person1#: Do you have any particular hobbies, Tom?\n#Person2#: Oh, yes. I love playing badminton, table tennis and computer games. And playing the games has become my favorite.\n#Person1#: I hear many teenagers will spend hours and hours sitting at computers. And they don't care about their own health at all. How about you?\n#Person2#: I'm no better than them. They say it's mindless to sit in front of a machine all the time, but I think it's stimulating.\n#Person1#: You won't play online games full of violence, will you?\n#Person2#: Once in a while.\n#Person1#: It's no good. And I think spending several hours each day playing computer games is a waste of time. You might as well do something healthy and meaningful.\n#Person2#: I hope I can practice self-control again.
#Person1#: What are you here for today?\n#Person2#: I need to fight this ticket that I got.\n#Person1#: Is the arresting officer here?\n#Person2#: Yes, he is, Your Honor.\n#Person1#: Plead your case.\n#Person2#: I was told by the officer that I ran a red light. That information isn't true.\n#Person1#: Why would the officer lie?\n#Person2#: I'm not sure, but the signal had a camera on it.\n#Person1#: Did the camera take a picture of your license plate?\n#Person2#: No, my picture wasn't taken.\n#Person1#: There was no picture taken, so I'll let you go.\n#Person2#: Thank you very much, Your Honor.
#Person1#: All right. I want to bring everybody in on this project. When can we start working on this?\n#Person2#: Well, we could probably get started with a strategy meeting tomorrow morning at 8: 00.\n#Person1#: I tell you what, 8: 00 is no good for me, but why don't you guys get started and I'll come by at around 8: 45 or so.\n#Person2#: That's fine with me. How much time are we going to have to work on this?
#Person1#: Excuse me, how can I get to the bank? Bank of America; I mean. I don't know the way.\n#Person2#: Well, go straight ahead till you see a supermarket. The bank is just at the other side of the street.\n#Person1#: Is it far from here?\n#Person2#: Let me see. Er, it's 4 blocks away. Not very far, not very near.\n#Person1#: Can I take a bus or something?\n#Person2#: You may take Bus No. 104 or a street car B-201, 4 stops by bus and 3 stops by street car.\n#Person1#: But where can I take the street car?\n#Person2#: Oh, the stop is just over there, at the bookstore. See?\n#Person1#: Many thanks.\n#Person2#: You're welcome.
#Person1#: Excuse me, ah, was my bedroom cleaned this morning?\n#Person2#: Yes, Madam. All the rooms are cleaned in the morning, Madam.\n#Person1#: Well, then I have a bit of a problem\n#Person2#: Is your room not satisfactory, Madam?\n#Person1#: No, it's not that. It's just that I can't find my necklace.\n#Person2#: I'm sorry, Madam. Can you tell me a little bit more about it?\n#Person1#: Well this morning I left my necklace here on the table by the bed but it's just nowhere to be found.\n#Person2#: I will report this to the manager right away, Madam.
#Person1#: There is an element there about competition then, isn't there? Because British railways are a nationalized industry. There's only one railway system in the country. If you don't like a particular kind of big beans, you can go and buy another. But if you don't like a particular railway, you can't go and use another.\n#Person2#: Some people who write to me say this. They say that if you didn't have a monopoly, you wouldn't be able to do the things you do. Well, I don't think we do anything deliberately to upset our customers. We have particular problems. Since 1946, when the Transport Act came in, we were nationalized.\n#Person1#: Do you think that's a good thing? Has it been a good thing for the railways, do you think, to be nationalized?\n#Person2#: Oh I think so, yes. Because in general, modes of transport are all around. Let's face the fact. The car arrived. The car is here to stay. There is no question about that.\n#Person1#: So what are you saying then? Is it if the railways happen being nationalized, they would simply have disappeared?\n#Person2#: Oh, I think they would have. They're disappearing fast in America. Er, the French railways lose 1 billion pounds a year. The German railways, 2 billion pounds a year. But you see, those governments are preparing to pour money into the transport system to keep it going.\n#Person1#: So in a sense, you cope between two extremes. On the one hand, you're trying not to lose too much money. And on the other hand, you've got to provide the best service.\n#Person2#: Yes, you are right.
#Person1#: Compared with the yellow one, you look more beautiful in this white skirt.\n#Person2#: Thank you. I like the white one better. But how much will you charge me?\n#Person1#: It costs $100, but I'd like to take off 30%, and that's it.
#Person1#: OK. We have to make a decision. Who is the best one interviewed for the job?\n#Person2#: Um, let's see. First we saw Frank. He's very polite and relaxed. But he wasn't well dressed. He wasn't even wearing a tie.\n#Person1#: That's true, dressing well is important. Well, let's think about the others. What about Susan? She had a nice voice and was nicely dressed.\n#Person2#: Well, she did look very neat, very nicely dressed. But she was so shy. She wouldn't be very good at talking to people at the front desk.\n#Person1#: OK. Now who was next? Ar...Yes, David. What do you think?\n#Person2#: Eh... He seemed like a very bright guy. He dressed very nicely and had a really nice appearance.\n#Person1#: He was polite, but also very friendly and relaxed with me, the type of person people feel comfortable with right away.\n#Person2#: And he answered Dona's questions very well. I think he'll be good with the guests at the front desk.\n#Person1#: That's right. OK. Good! I guess we have our receptionist then, don't you?
#Person1#: Good afternoon! Did you call for a plumber? \n#Person2#: Yes, yes I did. Please come in! I'm so glad you came! This old house is falling apart! Come on into the \n#Person1#: I see. Let me have a look. It seems that your toilet is clogged, and that's why it won't flush. Let me just get\n#Person2#: Oh, that must be because of my four-year-old daughter. She is always flushing things down the toilet. You know \n#Person1#: Yeah, I have a little one myself. Anyway, these water pipes are really rusty, so they also should be changed. That \n#Person2#: That would be great! Is it expensive? \n#Person1#: Let's see. . . I would say about eight hundred dollars. 
#Person1#: Did you hear what happened in the Scott case? Some of the sensitive material were leaked to the press. Now every newspapers is all over it. \n#Person2#: Oh. . . I bet the firm is fuming. Do they know who spilled the beans? \n#Person1#: I'm sure they have their suspicions; there were only a few of the senior level lawers who were privy to the case details. \n#Person2#: What kind of repercussions will there be for the people who are held responsible? \n#Person1#: I'm sure there'll be canned! And there also might be some legal consequences. \n#Person2#: Why would the person who told have problems with the law? \n#Person1#: Because whoever let the cat out of the bag was breaking client confidentiality. \n#Person2#: I didn't think about that. That's pretty serious. Are there investigators working on finding out who it was? \n#Person1#: I'm sure management is on top of it. 
#Person1#: May I help you, sir? \n#Person2#: Yes, please. I'd like to buy a gift for my younger brother. He's going to take a trip to South America. \n#Person1#: By air or by sea? \n#Person2#: By air. So my gift should be quite light. What can you suggest? \n#Person1#: How about this wallet? It's made of fine leather. \n#Person2#: My sister already gave him one. I like something unusual. \n#Person1#: This gift is the best for a man who has everything. \n#Person2#: Oh, a nice handkerchief. That's a great idea. I'll take it. 
#Person1#: I am trying to decide what school to apply to? \n#Person2#: Are you thinking about a public school or a private one? \n#Person1#: I am not sure. What's the difference between them? \n#Person2#: Public schools are usually state funded, whereas private schools usually get their funding elsewhere. \n#Person1#: Which is better? \n#Person2#: One isn't necessarily better than the other. It depends a lot on the school administration and the teachers. \n#Person1#: I hear you have to wear uniforms at private school. \n#Person2#: Yes, sometimes. 
#Person1#: This is ridiculous! I can't believe you've been sleeping with someone else! How could you do this! You know what? I'm out of here! \n#Person2#: Wait! Doctor how is this possible? I haven't cheated on my boyfriend! \n#Person3#: I have something to confess. . . I'm sorry Veronica, I lied. \n#Person2#: Wait. . . what? What do do you mean? \n#Person3#: I lied. You aren't even pregnant. there's no bun in the oven. I was just so overwhelmed with jealousy that I couldn't help myself. Veronica I love you! \n#Person2#: What are you talking about! ! ! Who are you? \n#Person3#: It's me! Daniel, don't you remember me? From high school. I sat behind you every day in class! I used to go to every football game and watch you in the cheerleading squad! \n#Person2#: You are insane! We never even spoke! Why did you lie like that to my boyfriend? \n#Person3#: Because Veronica. . . It's not fair! I love you; I have since the first day we met! Everything was going fine until that jerk came into the picture and ruined everything! I went to med school and became a doctor for you! You always said how you wanted to marry a doctor! You will be mine now. . . one way or another. . . \n#Person1#: I heard everything, you lying bastard! Get your hands off her! 
#Person1#: So Kim, have you ever had anything stolen? \n#Person2#: Stolen? No, why? \n#Person1#: My uncle just had his motorcycle stolen a few nights ago. I was just thinking about how clever criminals are these days. \n#Person2#: Criminals are clever? They're only successful when people are careless. \n#Person1#: I don't know. The ones who stole my uncle's motorcycle were pretty good. \n#Person2#: If your uncle had an alarm system, then it wouldn't have happened. \n#Person1#: He did. It was one of the best ones available. But that didn't stop them from disabling it. And on a crowded street too. \n#Person2#: Didn't anyone stop them? \n#Person1#: You would think that people would be smart enough to stop something like that. No one knew his motorcycle was being stolen. The thieves came in a truck and convinced everybody that my uncle was parked illegally and they were there to tow it away. \n#Person2#: Wow, they were good. I guess criminals aren't that dumb after all. \n#Person1#: That's not the end. They were so good that they convinced a bystander to help them lift the motorcycle and put it in the truck. 
#Person1#: Have you received your TOFEL test results yet? \n#Person2#: Yes, I did. I passed ! \n#Person1#: Congratulations! I knew you could do it. \n#Person2#: Well, I certainly couldn't have done it without your help. You are the best tutor I've ever had. \n#Person1#: Thank you , but it was your hard work that did it. \n#Person2#: You deserve credit, too. I've learned so much from You. 
#Person1#: Good afternoon, sir. \n#Person2#: Good afternoon. I have a reservation under the name of Hilton. \n#Person1#: Could you spell that, please? \n#Person2#: Sure. It's H-I-L-T-O-N. \n#Person1#: One moment, please. Ah yes, Mr. Hilton, you booked a single room for three nights. Is that correct? \n#Person2#: Yes, that's right. \n#Person1#: I see from the computer that you are a frequent guest here. Do you have your loyalty card? \n#Person2#: Yes, here you are. And here's my credit card, too. \n#Person1#: Thank you. Right, your room number is 105. Here's your key and receipt. Thank you for choosing our hotel again, sir. \n#Person2#: Thank you, goodbye. \n#Person1#: Goodbye. 
#Person1#: This one looks great! I love the seashore. \n#Person2#: So do I. The sun . . . the sand . . . the ocean! \n#Person1#: And listen to this! What do you think of sailing, swimming, windsurfing, and fishing? \n#Person2#: Oh, Tom! They sound fantastic. I really like all those things. \n#Person1#: Yeah . . . me, too. \n#Person2#: Well, except fishing. To be honest, I hate fishing, but I love all the others. \n#Person1#: Hey! Look at this! We can stay in a big hotel or we can stay in a little cabin by the beach. \n#Person2#: You know. I really don't those big hotels. \n#Person1#: Neither do I. Let's stay in a cabin. It'll be much nicer right beside the ocean. 
#Person1#: Tom, what are you going to do this weekend?\n#Person2#: I have no idea. Usually I stay at home and watch TV. Sometimes I play computer games. Do you have any good ideas?\n#Person1#: Let's go to the cinema. I haven't seen a movie for a long time. I heard Ice Age 4 is really popular. Let's go and see it.\n#Person2#: Oh, I'm not really interested in cartoons. How about playing tennis at the gym?\n#Person1#: OK. I like sports. When and where shall we meet?\n#Person2#: Let's meet at the gym at 9:00 o'clock on Saturday morning.\n#Person1#: OK. See you then.\n#Person2#: See you.
#Person1#: Hello, how may I help you?\n#Person2#: Hello, I seem to have a problem with my computer.\n#Person1#: Alright. Let's see. What about tomorrow morning about 10:00?\n#Person2#: Oh, no. That won't do I'm afraid. I've got a very important report on the computer that must be finished and handed in by 9:00 AM tomorrow. By 10:00 it's too late I'm afraid. Can't you come now?\n#Person1#: Well, I'm at a job at the moment and my wife and kids are expecting me home by 8:00 PM for dinner.\n#Person2#: I know it's Sunday evening. Can you at least suggest someone else who can work? I've been calling numbers in the phone books and you're the only one that answered.\n#Person1#: Just a moment. Don't worry. Where are you now?\n#Person2#: I'm at my office. I work in the morning side area.\n#Person1#: Well, you're in luck. I have to pass your area on my way home. Now I should be finished here by 7:30, so what about around 7:45? Is that OK?\n#Person2#: That's great. Thank you.
#Person1#: Welcome to tonight's Legendary Lives. I'm Shirley Morgan. Tonight, we are quite honored to invite David Hopkins, a well known chef with 30 years of cooking experience. Last year, his new book, Secrets in the Kitchen got on a New York Times best seller list for 6 months. Welcome to our program, David.\n#Person2#: Hello, Shirley, it's a pleasure to be here.\n#Person1#: David, I can't wait to see you uncovered a formulas for dishes. Exploring the How's and why's of cooking. Before that, may I ask you a question? What's the difference between a chef and a cook?\n#Person2#: I think cooks generally work at entry level jobs. They work at different places in the kitchen and follow recipes. In contrast, chefs have special training and understand better which food goes well together, so they can invent new recipes.\n#Person1#: I see, a chef is the cook, who has completed a professional course while a cook it's basically any person who cooks food. By the way, how do you become a chef?\n#Person2#: I am trained. 95% is about professional training and the other 5% is about talent.\n#Person1#: Would you mind describing us a day of a chef? We're so curious about that.\n#Person2#: Nothing special, I generally go to work 2 hours before service starts. The night before, I've written the lists of all the things we need to prepare the next day. I work in different roles depending on what is needed.\n#Person1#: Challenging. How long do you work everyday?\n#Person2#: 10 to 12 hours a day.\n#Person1#: An almost full time job! Do you have any tips for average cooks, like me?\n#Person2#: Cooking involves your passion and creativity. Kitchen is never a place to chop vegetables, and have a quick breakfast. It is good to make food that people really enjoy.\n#Person1#: I can't agree with you more. Miracles happen in the kitchen. Thanks for joining us, David.\n#Person2#: My pleasure.
#Person1#: Can you help me find some books? I need them for my class. I'm writing a report about US history.\n#Person2#: Of course. Do you know how to use our computers? Our entire book collection is on our website. You can look up the books you need, then I'll walk you over to their location in the main building.\n#Person1#: Thank you, but I'm not sure which books to look up on the computer. My topic is very general. How can I search for a few books on a topic instead of one specific book?\n#Person2#: I'll show you. Type your topic into the search box on the screen and a list of books will come up. Then pick the few books that you want and will look for them on the bookshelves.\n#Person1#: Thank you.\n#Person2#: Remember, you can only check out up to three books at a time.
#Person1#: Mom, I'm a little worried about college. I just don't know what to study. I don't know what my major should be.\n#Person2#: That can be a difficult decision, John.\n#Person1#: How can I decide?\n#Person2#: Well, I'd start with your interests. It will help you if you study something that you are interested in. What do you like to read and learn about or do?\n#Person1#: I guess I like dancing and helping people. Those are my interest I guess.\n#Person2#: What do you mean by helping people?\n#Person1#: If people have problems, I like to help solve them. Or if people are hurt, I like to try to do things that make them feel better.\n#Person2#: It sounds like you might be interested in medicine then.\n#Person1#: Uh... I don't know.\n#Person2#: Another thing I think you should consider is the possible jobs you might get and how much money you want to make.\n#Person1#: How do I figure that?\n#Person2#: You can research different jobs at the library and there are reports and data on how well different jobs pay.\n#Person1#: I want to have a well paid job so that I can have money to travel.\n#Person2#: Well, there you go. Income is going to influence you most in your choice of nature. There is one other thing you should consider, too.\n#Person1#: What's that?\n#Person2#: You know, scholarships, then money given to you for college. You might want to pick a major that will allow you to get a special scholarship. I know you'll make the right decision.\n#Person1#: Thanks, mom.
#Person1#: I'm glad you could find time to meet with me, Mr. Johnson. I can't think of a nicer environment for our meeting today, the ambiance here is lovely!\n#Person2#: No problem, if possible I always combine business with pleasure. Now, let's hear more about these chocolates you're offering.\n#Person1#: Well, as you know, I have recently become the sole distributor for Grangers Gourmet Bon-bons here in the United States. They're a new manufacturer and are looking to break into the luxury market. Naturally, your restaurant sprang into my mind immediately. I think your brand exemplifies many of the same traits as Grangers and serving these chocolates would really add to your reputation for providing elegant, luxurious, first class dining.\n#Person2#: Mmmm, sounds interesting. . . gourmet chocolates, where are they produced? Belgium?\n#Person1#: Actually, the factory is located in Scotland.\n#Person2#: Really? I didn't think they were known for their luxury chocolate production. . .\n#Person1#: That's what makes this such a fantastic opportunity! The government is one hundred percent supportive of creating new export markets and has guaranteed a low tariff for all wholesale orders of over one thousand units. They'Ve also reduced the red tape involved at customs as well. Here, I brought these especially for you, try one!\n#Person2#: Oh, thanks. Mmm, hmm, creamy texture, very smooth. . .\n#Person1#: Unique, aren't they? I bet you'Ve never tasted anything like it! Quality is assured as I personally visit the factory to make sure no one's cutting corners with the ingredients. Only the creme make it through inspection.\n#Person2#: Yes, very interesting flavors. . . Slightly spicy, very unique, that's for sure. Exactly what ARE the ingredients?\n#Person1#: I have it on highest authority that this traditional secret recipe has been handed down in the Granger family for generations. I'm sure you can keep a secret. Buttermilk, cacao beans, sugar and Haggis.\n#Person2#: Haggis? What's Haggis?\n#Person1#: It's a traditional Scottish delicacy ; you take sheep's liver, heart and lung and stuff it inside of the sheep's stomach.
#Person1#: Excuse me. What should I wear if I want to go to an interview?\n#Person2#: You should wear a tie to go with your suit.\n#Person1#: I am afraid I would tense up during the interview.\n#Person2#: It doesn't matter. Just do your best to sell yourself.
#Person1#: Mr. Black, I'd like to take some time off. I'Ve been feeling exhausted these days.\n#Person2#: That's no problem. Let me see. . . You still have ten days annual leave left, is that right?\n#Person1#: Yes. I was wondering if I could take another two weeks off.\n#Person2#: That's long leave. How's your project coming along?\n#Person1#: The project I'm in charged of now will be done by the end of this week. I'd like to take my leave from next Monday on.\n#Person2#: Well, all right. But you make sure to tie up loose ends before you leave.\n#Person1#: Thank you, Mr. Black. There are no immediate projects coming up at the moment. Mr. Smith will be in charge during my absence. He is taking part in several projects as my assistant and knows how to maintain relationships with our clients.\n#Person2#: Great! I hope you have a good relaxation and come back refreshed.\n#Person1#: I will. Many thanks, Mr. Black.
#Person1#: I would like to make an offer on this house, but I don't know much about the process.\n#Person2#: As your realtor, I am here to take care of this process. How much were you planning on offering?\n#Person1#: I really like the house and will pay the full asking price of three hundred and fifty thousand dollars.\n#Person2#: We want to leave ourselves some bargaining room. Let's offer three hundred and twenty thousand dollars.\n#Person1#: That sounds good, but I don't want this house to get away from me.\n#Person2#: The market is fairly down right now, so the offer is a realistic one.\n#Person1#: When will we know if they accept the offer?\n#Person2#: The owners usually respond to an offer within a few days.\n#Person1#: Should I be contacting my bank in the meantime?\n#Person2#: You are already pre-qualified for your loan, so you are in good shape.
#Person1#: There is a tornado warning on. My mother just told me she heard it on the radio.\n#Person2#: What is a tornado warning?\n#Person1#: It means that a tornado has been seen somewhere in the area.\n#Person2#: Really? In New Berlin?\n#Person1#: No. Not necessarily in town. But in southern Wisconsin somewhere. A tornado has been spotted. They have two stages here. This is what is called a tornado watch. That means that the weather conditions are perfect for a tornado.\n#Person2#: I understand. They think a tornado might come.\n#Person1#: Yes. People should look out, because maybe there will be tornadoes coming. So it's called a watch.\n#Person2#: And the second stage is called a tornado warning.\n#Person1#: Yes. If a tornado has been spotted, they announce a tornado warning. So if there's a tornado warning on, it means a tornado is out there somewhere.\n#Person2#: It's scary.\n#Person1#: Well. Tornadoes can be dangerous, it's true. If we hear something like a loud train coming, then we have to go in the basement.\n#Person2#: What do you mean a loud train?\n#Person1#: That is what tornadoes sound like. They sound like trains. They're very loud.\n#Person2#: But if you hear them coming, isn't it already too late?\n#Person1#: Maybe. It depends on the tornado. Some can move across the ground at 200 miles an hour. That is very fast. Others aren't so fast.\n#Person2#: Have you seen a lot of them?\n#Person1#: I've only seen one in my life. I was looking out the window. It was around two miles away. It was very interesting to watch. But it was heading toward my friend's house. So I quickly called them on the phone.\n#Person2#: Did it hit their house?\n#Person1#: No, it didn't. But they are glad I called them.\n#Person2#: What were they doing when you called?\n#Person1#: They were all sitting in the living room watching TV. They had no idea a tornado was coming toward their house. If it had hit them, they could have all been killed.\n#Person2#: That's terrible. Do many people die in tornadoes?\n#Person1#: Not so many really. But a lot of houses are destroyed sometimes.
#Person1#: Did you do anything fun over the weekend?\n#Person2#: I didn't want to go out last weekend, so I decided to stay at home and watch a movie.\n#Person1#: Why didn't you want to go out?\n#Person2#: I was very tired after working all week. Sometimes on the weekend I don't have enough energy to go out to a movie theater.\n#Person1#: Did you download a movie or rent it at the store?\n#Person2#: I downloaded it so that I didn't have to remember to return it.
#Person1#: I heard you are going to move.\n#Person2#: Yes, I found a better house near my office. I'm very satisfied with it. But I'm worrying.\n#Person1#: What are you worried about?\n#Person2#: I'm worrying about how to move all of my household stuff. You know, I have a lot of stuff.\n#Person1#: You can call a mover.\n#Person2#: How much dose that cost?\n#Person1#: Around 200 RMB for a truck.\n#Person2#: I think it's a little expensive.\n#Person1#: But think about it, you just need to pack your stuff and leave everything for the movers, how much trouble you will save.\n#Person2#: That's right.\n#Person1#: I know a mover which has a very good reputation for their service. I'll leave you their phone number.\n#Person2#: Wonderful.\n#Person1#: It's 8357688 8.\n#Person2#: Okay, thanks a lot. You did me a great favor just now.\n#Person1#: You're welcome.
#Person1#: This is my admission card, and these are the books.\n#Person2#: OK, a moment, please.\n#Person1#: By the way, can I renew the borrowing?\n#Person2#: For which one?\n#Person1#: Sense and Sensibility, English version.\n#Person2#: Yes, of course.\n#Person1#: Can I just do it here?\n#Person2#: Sorry. No, you cannot. You should go to the other counter.\n#Person1#: OK, thanks.\n#Person2#: Sorry, this biography is over the deadline. You have to pay extra for it.\n#Person1#: I was thinking of buying this from the bookstore when my father got this from the library. . . anyway, how much should I pay?\n#Person2#: 3 Yuan, please.\n#Person1#: Here you are. Thanks.\n#Person2#: You are welcome. See you next time.
#Person1#: Tom, aren't you a little too old to be trick-or-treating?\n#Person2#: What are you talking about? Where is your Halloween spirit? Didn't you ever dress up in a costume and go around the neighborhood trick-or-treating with your friends?\n#Person1#: Of course, I did, but when I was ten! Trick - or-treating is for kids, plus, I'm sure people will think you're a kidnapper or something, running around with kids NCP at night.\n#Person2#: Whatever, I'm going next door I heard Mrs. Robinson is giving out big bags of M & Ms!
#Person1#: He's only interested in harassing you. How can he expect us to have so much time to waste?\n#Person2#: I almost want to send him a virus to shut his stupid computer down.\n#Person1#: As obnoxious as Bean is, we should still try to finish this case.\n#Person2#: True-well, do you have any forwards for me to send him?\n#Person1#: Yeah! Remember that one about putting light bulbs in your mouth?
#Person1#: Would you mind if I make a suggestion?\n#Person2#: Of course not, go ahead.\n#Person1#: Maybe you should try to quit smoking. You know it is very bad for your health.\n#Person2#: Well, sure it is. Actually, I have been cutting down the amount since two months ago. I used to smoke a pack of cigarettes for a single day. Now I limit it to 6 cigarettes a day.\n#Person1#: You have made a big progress. Quitting smoking is not an easy job. But it will be rewarding in the long run.\n#Person2#: Thank you for your suggestion.\n#Person1#: You're welcome.
#Person1#: Life's so boring.\n#Person2#: Well, most of the time it is, I guess.\n#Person1#: What do you think will make you happy?\n#Person2#: I think money will make me happy.\n#Person1#: You heard people say that money doesn't guarantee happiness.\n#Person2#: It will for me. Then I can do all the things I want to do.\n#Person1#: You'll get bored eventually.\n#Person2#: Then I can find something new to do. If I don't have to worry about money, then I don't have to work.\n#Person1#: That's true, I guess. If I didn't have to work, I think I would be happy.\n#Person2#: You see. . . money doesn't equal happiness, but it takes away a lot of responsibilities.
#Person1#: Excuse me. Do you study Chinese at the university here?\n#Person2#: Yes, I do. But my characters are very bad.\n#Person1#: It takes a long time to learn Chinese writing.\n#Person2#: Are you Chinese?\n#Person1#: Yes, I am. I am from Taiwan. I came here to study political science.\n#Person2#: How do you like it?\n#Person1#: I like it so far. But my English still needs work.\n#Person2#: I want to study Mandarin and international relations.\n#Person1#: Does the Chinese department here teach regular characters or simplified characters?\n#Person2#: They teach regular characters.\n#Person1#: I see. I'm from Taiwan, so I know regular characters better than simplified.\n#Person2#: You just said your English needs work, yes?\n#Person1#: Yes, that's true. Especially my writing. I think my papers aren't good enough. I make too many grammatical mistakes.\n#Person2#: Well, I am very serious about learning Chinese. But for me the hard part now is pronunciation. You have the four tones in Chinese. It is very hard. Maybe, if you have time, maybe we could do a language exchange.\n#Person1#: You mean you and I?\n#Person2#: Yes, why not? I mean, if you come to this cafe often, maybe we could meet here and practice Chinese and English.\n#Person1#: That sounds like a good idea. How often would you like to do it?\n#Person2#: Let's see. . . My schedule right now is quite busy. But I think I could spend 90 minutes a week in language exchange.\n#Person1#: How would we manage it though? How would we spend the 90 minutes?\n#Person2#: First, we could spend 45 minutes working on your English writing. If you want, I could help you edit your papers. Or we could do English conversation. Whatever you want. And then the next 45 minutes you would help me with my Chinese.\n#Person1#: Would I help you with writing?\n#Person2#: No. For me right now, the important thing is spoken Chinese. I need practice. So you could tutor me in speaking. We could use my textbook, and you could ask me questions. Then you could correct my mistakes.\n#Person1#: I think it sounds like a good system. But when is it convenient to meet?\n#Person2#: Well, today is Monday. Actually, for me Monday at this time would be the best. I am free from now until 11\n#Person1#: Me too. In fact, I'm free until 1\n#Person2#: So if you want to meet at 10\n#Person1#: It sounds good. I will bring the papers I'm working on.\n#Person2#: And I will bring my textbook and a tape recorder. I would like to record some things so I can practice on my own.\n#Person1#: Let me give you my phone number.\n#Person2#: Sure. I'll give you mine too. Then we can call if we have to cancel for some reason.
#Person1#: How can I help you today, Alice?\n#Person2#: Well, I came to talk to you because I want to apply for a scholarship.\n#Person1#: Oh, good. You're an excellent student. I'd be very willing to help you with that.\n#Person2#: Thanks. I really appreciate it. In fact, I do need a letter of recommendation for this scholarship.\n#Person1#: What kind of scholarship is it?\n#Person2#: It's an undergraduate scholarship offered by the American Minority Students Scholarship Association. I'm eligible for it because I'm Asian American.\n#Person1#: Fine. I know about that scholarship. You have to be a student in your junior year, and you have to have a grade point average of 3. 7 or higher.\n#Person2#: I'm a junior now, and my GPA is 3. 92.\n#Person1#: Excellent. So you'll have a good chance of getting it.\n#Person2#: Well, I hope so. The competition is probably pretty heavy. And they want a writing sample too.\n#Person1#: Do you have an essay you want to send them?\n#Person2#: No, they want a special essay. I must write an essay on a particular question they pose.\n#Person1#: What is the question?\n#Person2#: They give applicants a topic. The topic is, The Place of Ethnic Minorities in a Democratic Society. My essay must be three pages typed and double-spaced.\n#Person1#: That's a pretty short essay.\n#Person2#: Yes, but I need to write it by next week.\n#Person1#: Good luck. I'm sure you will do a good job.\n#Person2#: I came here today to talk to you because. . . Well, I need to ask two favors.\n#Person1#: Sure. What are they?\n#Person2#: First, I need a letter of recommendation.\n#Person1#: I'd be happy to write one for you.\n#Person2#: And second. . . Well, I'm not sure if it's normal.\n#Person1#: What is it? Do you want me to read your essay?\n#Person2#: Yes, if you could. I mean, if you could read it to make sure there are no mistakes. Or maybe you'd have some suggestions.\n#Person1#: Of course I could read it. That's no problem. But you need to get it to me soon.\n#Person2#: I will. I want to write the first draft tonight. So I could bring it tomorrow morning.\n#Person1#: Alright. If you can bring it to me tomorrow morning, I can talk with you after class on Friday. So I'll have some feedback for you before the weekend.\n#Person2#: That would really help me a lot. I'm very grateful.\n#Person1#: Don't mention it. I'm always willing to help good students.
#Person1#: What is your major?\n#Person2#: My major is Business Administration, I am especially interested in Marketing.\n#Person1#: Which university are you attending?\n#Person2#: I attended Suzhou University.\n#Person1#: Have you received any degrees?\n#Person2#: Yes. I received my Bachelor degree in Business Administration.\n#Person1#: What course did you like best?\n#Person2#: Project Management. I was very interested in this course when I was a student. And I think it's very useful for my present work.\n#Person1#: Do you feel that you have received a good general training?\n#Person2#: Yes, I have studied in an English training program and a computer training program since I graduated from university. I am currently studying Finance at a training school.\n#Person1#: English and computer skills are comparatively important to this post, especially in the starting period. Wharfs your ability in these two fields?\n#Person2#: I passed college English Test Band - 4, with good skill in listening, speaking, reading and writing. I haven't got any certificate of computer skills, because I don't think certificates are necessary if what's needed is merely operating a computer. I think, to know how to use a computer is more important. And I'm quite familiar with Microsoft Office
#Person1#: Jane, we are going to have a board meeting next Friday. Will you please arrange it for me?\n#Person2#: Certainly, Mr. Robert. But can I have your plan?\n#Person1#: Sure. Actually it's a routine board meeting. The things to be discussed are all written here.\n#Person2#: Very good. May I keep it? I need it to draw up a notice of the meeting and the agenda.\n#Person1#: Go ahead. It's for your reference. While you are at it, make me a special agenda and don't forget to have enough room at the side for notes.\n#Person2#: You mean you need a more detailed agenda for yourself?\n#Person1#: Exactly. As I am supposed to the chair of the meeting, I don't want it to get out of control.\n#Person2#: I see. Ok, then where do you think we will have the meeting?\n#Person1#: The conference room on the second floor, is that ok?\n#Person2#: Yes, I will see that the room is ready by Friday. And I will check there are enough chairs, and the lighting and air-conditioning are all right.\n#Person1#: Good, and please get some water, glasses and ash tray ready as well.\n#Person2#: Sure, I will. What about the minutes? Do you think I am responsible for that too?\n#Person1#: Definitely. The minutes have to be taken accurately.\n#Person2#: But I am not familiar with the members of the board.\n#Person1#: Oh, that's easy. I will write you a list of their names. You can make a seating plan with the names and give each one a number.\n#Person2#: That's a good idea. All right, I'll withdraw and get down to it if you don't mind.
#Person1#: How are your stocks doing, Jim?\n#Person2#: Oh, all right. I lost a bunch of money in the last two years, but this year has been pretty good.\n#Person1#: Yeah, I lost money investing in the internet too.\n#Person2#: Just goes to show that you should buy companies not ideas.\n#Person1#: I changed my strategy around too. I invest in good companies now.\n#Person2#: Yeah, me too. Did you hear about Ted?\n#Person1#: No. What happened?\n#Person2#: He lost his kids'college money by trading.\n#Person1#: Oh, boy. His wife can't be happy about that.
#Person1#: May I help you, sir?\n#Person2#: Fill it up with regular, please.\n#Person1#: Should I take a look at your battery?\n#Person2#: No, thanks. I'm in a hurry.\n#Person1#: Your car is ready.\n#Person2#: Good! How much is it?\n#Person1#: 250 yuan, please!\n#Person2#: That is expensive.\n#Person1#: You should know about the oil crisis.
#Person1#: Can I ask you a question?\n#Person2#: Sure, go ahead.\n#Person1#: How do you get along with the American students in your classes?\n#Person2#: I don't have much contact with them.\n#Person1#: Really? Why not? Don't you go up and talk to them?\n#Person2#: No, I don't. I'm too afraid of making mistakes in English. I don't want to be laughed at.\n#Person1#: You won't get anywhere that way. You're the one who needs to practice English, so you should make the first move. Besides, most American students are really friendly and outgoing. They will be glad to talk to you.\n#Person2#: Thanks for the advice. I guess you're right. It's just hard to overcome my shyness. I really will try from now on. I promise.

Oh, I have an appointment tonight.\n#Person2#: What time is your appointment?\n#Person1#: It is at 8 o'clock.\n#Person2#: What time is now? Do you have the correct time?\n#Person1#: I don't know what time it is. It must be about 6 o'clock. I have to go now. I don't want to be late.\n#Person2#: You won't be late. It's still early.
#Person1#: Can I help you, Miss?\n#Person2#: Do you have anything which can prevent wrinkles and freckles?\n#Person1#: What is your skin type?\n#Person2#: My skin is kind of oily.\n#Person1#: This nutrition cream is for anti-wrinkling and whitening which is a newcomer brand.\n#Person2#: How much is it?\n#Person1#: $ 60. The price is reasonable for its large quantity. What's more, there are some gifts attaching for you.\n#Person2#: Sounds good. What are the gifts attaching?\n#Person1#: You can take one tonic or hand cream.\n#Person2#: I will choose the tonic.\n#Person1#: No problem. You can try this kind of gel which can prevent freckle, the effect will be better if you use this powder foundation applied with it.\n#Person2#: That's the very thing I want.
#Person1#: Why don't you begin by telling me something about yourself?\n#Person2#: What do you want to know?\n#Person1#: The usual, you know, something about your background and experience and anything personal that you feel is pertinent.\n#Person2#: Well, I was born in Shanghai and went to school there, right up through college. My father is a lawyer, and my mother is a teacher.\n#Person1#: Sounds as if you come from a professional family.\n#Person2#: That right. One of my sisters is a doctor and the other one teaches at a university.\n#Person1#: What made you decide to get into computers?\n#Person2#: Oh, nothing in particular, I guess. I always liked mathematics and tinkering with machines.\n#Person1#: Now what about your experience? How long have you been working with computers?\n#Person2#: More than five years now. After I did my engineering degree, I began to specialize in computer technology and I even had my own company for a while.\n#Person1#: It certainly sounds impressive. Why don't you have your credentials sent to me and I'll show them to the board? We'll probably get back to you in a week.\n#Person2#: Thanks very much.
#Person1#: Who is Cindy's husband?\n#Person2#: Cindy's husband is Ron.\n#Person1#: How many children do Cindy and Ron have?\n#Person2#: They have two children-one son and one daughter-as well as one daughter-in-law and one son-in-law.\n#Person1#: Do they have any grandchildren?\n#Person2#: Yes, they have three grandchildren-one girl and two boys.\n#Person1#: Does their daughter get along well with her in-laws?\n#Person2#: Yes, she gets along with them quite well.\n#Person1#: Do they have a large family?\n#Person2#: Their family is very similar to Cindy and Ron's family.
#Person1#: What is your long-term goal in this career?\n#Person2#: My long-term goal is to become an expert in this field.\n#Person1#: What would you do to achieve that?\n#Person2#: In order to achieve that objective. I would work step by step and make further study.
#Person1#: Bill, I'm expecting a big increase in turnover with the coming of the Mid-Autumn Festival. But wholesales are unwilling to supply my orders unless I pay them an advance of 50 % of the full price, for my business is fairly new. I hope that you can make me an advance on loan.\n#Person2#: Do you have stocks or a title deed of a house to pledge as security?\n#Person1#: No. I should be grateful if you could see your way to make an advance against my personal reputation. You may inspect my accounts. From my accounts you can see that I've promptly met all my obligations.\n#Person2#: We do not allow any request for a loan against personal security. This is a common regulation. But we may consider it if you can provide a reliable guarantor.\n#Person1#: Yes, I can. You know Mr. Macready, the famous car dealer here in New York. He agreed to act as my guarantor of a loan in the sum of US $ l0, 000 until the end of this year.\n#Person2#: Good. He is a man of high standing. I think we can grant the loan you need after some further discussion. But I suggest you borrow on overdraft instead of on loan.
#Person1#: Say, have you heard about Jennie?\n#Person2#: No, what happened?\n#Person1#: She's had her baby.\n#Person2#: Oh, that's wonderful! When?\n#Person1#: A couple of weeks ago.\n#Person2#: Was it a boy or a girl?\n#Person1#: A girl.\n#Person2#: Oh, that's great! That's what she wanted, isn't it?\n#Person1#: Yeah, she always likes the girls.\n#Person2#: What are they going to call her?\n#Person1#: Christine, I think.
#Person1#: Suppose the company offer you a pay raise of 50%, would you be so determined to leave and look for a job as well?\n#Person2#: Yes, I've set my mind down on it. I'd like to find a job with full scope to show my ability.
#Person1#: You don't look very happy. What seems to be the problem?\n#Person2#: I've got to write a long composition for my English class, and I just can't come up with any ideas, and it is due tomorrow.\n#Person1#: That shouldn't be. too difficult. Remember those pictures you were showing me last week?\n#Person2#: Sure.\n#Person1#: Why don't you write something about the camel ride you took?\n#Person2#: That sounds like a good idea. I can also write about our visit to the North Africa.\n#Person1#: Well, now that you're feeling better, I think I'll be on my way. I've got to finish my composition too.\n#Person2#: Thanks for your help. I'm much more relaxed now and once I get organized, it won't be so difficult.
#Person1#: Reception. Can I help you?\n#Person2#: Yes, please. I'm Mrs. Browning calling from room 203.\n#Person1#: Yes, Madam.

#Person1#: Hi, Ruth. This is Steve speaking. How was the football game yesterday?\n#Person2#: Great. Why did you miss it? Steve?\n#Person1#: My parents didn't let me go because I had a fever. I'm still in bed.\n#Person2#: Too bad you weren't there. We all went together-- Jenny, Jimmy, George and I.\n#Person1#: It must have been freezing sitting outside, wasn't it?\n#Person2#: It was. We were all wrapped up in blankets, wool hats, and heavy coats.\n#Person1#: I hear it started snowing in the middle of the game.\n#Person2#: It did, lightly at first, then harder. But it didn't stop the game. That was the most exciting moment and it was so funny watching the players slipping in the snow.
#Person1#: Hello. This is the emergency 911 operator.\n#Person2#: Help. Help. Please help me!\n#Person1#: Yes sir. Please calm down and explain exactly what is happening.\n#Person2#: Calm down! My car is stalled on the freeway, I have a lady passenger, and she's going into labor.\n#Person1#: Now relax sir. Explain exactly where you are.\n#Person2#: I'm ... I'm in the southbound lane of the Lincoln Expressway, about 15 miles from the Washington Tunnel, and this lady isn't going to wait.\n#Person1#: Okay. What's your name sir and your passenger's?\n#Person2#: It's ... it's Bob, and I have no idea about the woman. She's in no condition to tell me.\n#Person1#: Okay, now what's the nearest landmark to your location? Pay careful attention.\n#Person2#: Umm, I see golden arches ... McDonalds.\n#Person1#: Okay, is there anyone else with you?\n#Person2#: No, and I've tried to get someone else to stop. [The sound of a bottle breaking.]\n#Person1#: Hey, what was that? [Ahhhh!]\n#Person2#: Ah, someone threw a bottle at me. How soon can someone get here?\n#Person1#: I've just dispatched an ambulance to your location. They should be there any second.\n#Person2#: Hey, is there anything I can do while we wait for the ambulance?\n#Person1#: Yes, uh, keep her calm and warm.\n#Person2#: Okay. Please hurry. Oh, they're too late. It's a boy!
#Person1#: Sorry, I'm late. Did you hear about the trains?\n#Person2#: Yes, I heard they were running late.\n#Person1#: Well, I realized I might be late, so I tried to find a bus and on my way I bumped into Jerry. He offered me a lift on his motorbike. But unfortunately, he was exhausted by flameout, so in the end, I had to walk.
#Person1#: Hi, Queenie, how are you enjoying yourself at university?\n#Person2#: Hi, Jack, it's a lot of work. But I am having a good time. Are you planning to attend college next year?\n#Person1#: Yeah. Can you tell me what facilities they have for disabled students? My wheelchair doesn't always allow me to get into buildings.\n#Person2#: You should inquire at Student Services. They can discuss your medical history with you confidentially and make allowances. My friends Shannon and Rosie use computers to do their exams, so in your case, I'm sure it would not be a problem.\n#Person1#: What about the wheelchair access?\n#Person2#: The newer buildings have elevators and wide doors, but the older buildings have not been upgraded to accommodate handicapped people as far as I know. What faculty are you planning to go into?\n#Person1#: I am thinking of doing engineering.\n#Person2#: Hmm. Engineering is in the old Adams building. I don't know if there is an elevator.\n#Person1#: Do the buses that go out to campus have facilities to bring wheelchairs on board?\n#Person2#: Yes, that I know for sure. All the buses are equipped with electronic lifts, and there are seats that fold back.\n#Person1#: What about the sidewalks?\n#Person2#: I think most of the sidewalks have been leveled at the corners, so you could probably use your wheelchair, but I am not sure. In fact, if you would like, why don't you come with me? I'll be taking the bus and I could show you around once we got there.\n#Person1#: That's really nice of you, Raphel. I'd really like that.\n#Person2#: Okay, I will come to your house about 8:30 in the morning and we can take the commuter train into town, then catch the bus up to the university.\n#Person1#: Great, I look forward to it.
#Person1#: Susan, I've got a few questions. Let's see. Can you type?\n#Person2#: No,I can't type.\n#Person1#: What about shorthand?\n#Person2#: I don't know. I've never tried.\n#Person1#: So you can't take shorthand and you can't type. What can you do, may I ask?\n#Person2#: Well, I can play the piano and the violin.\n#Person1#: Play the piano and the violin?\n#Person2#: Yes, and I can sing and dance.\n#Person1#: Susan, what are you doing here?\n#Person2#: I want a job. I want to work here.\n#Person1#: But you can't take shorthand, and you can't even type.\n#Person2#: No, of course I can't. I'm an actress.\n#Person1#: But I want a secretary.\n#Person2#: Is this the Grand Theater?\n#Person1#: No, of course not. It's the Grand Hotel. The Grand Theater is on the opposite street.
#Person1#: Is it your first time to join the sports meeting of Junior High School? \n#Person2#: Yes, and it's great.

Let's go have a look. \n#Person1#: OK, let's go. \n#Person2#: The competition will begin in 5 minutes, it's tense here. \n#Person1#: Wonderful, Bruce is taking the lead. \n#Person2#: Other competitors have almost caught up with him. They are neck and neck. \n#Person1#: Come on, Bruce. Come on, Bruce. \n#Person2#: Wow, Bruce crossed the line first. 
#Person1#: May I help you? \n#Person2#: My daughter. She is missing. I don't know where she is. \n#Person1#: What dose she look like? \n#Person2#: She has blond hair and blue eyes. \n#Person1#: What was she wearing? \n#Person2#: She has a yellow dress on and red sneakers. \n#Person1#: When did you last see her? \n#Person2#: I just saw her down the street. I don't know where she is. \n#Person1#: How long has it been? \n#Person2#: Oh, it's been uh... fifteen minutes. 
#Person1#: I can't wait to retire. \n#Person2#: And then what? \n#Person1#: And then I'm moving to Florida where I can play golf all day, every day! \n#Person2#: That sounds boring to me. \n#Person1#: What do you plan on doing after you retire? \n#Person2#: Yes, I think I will do something new. I've always wanted to be a teacher. \n#Person1#: I admire your energy, Ruth. You are young at heart. 
#Person1#: You are saying he will be promoted to the general manager? \n#Person2#: Yeah. \n#Person1#: Are you sure? \n#Person2#: Yes. I bet my bottom dollar that he will get promoted. \n#Person1#: Just because he gets on well with everybody? \n#Person2#: Partly, and he's also a hard working man. 
#Person1#: Isn't this great? I always wanted to own a farm, live out in the country, grow my own food! \n#Person2#: This is very beautiful. Though I have to confess, I don't know the first thing about farming! \n#Person1#: That's fine! Don't worry about it! \n#Person2#: What was that? \n#Person1#: Relax, it was just a goat! \n#Person2#: And that? \n#Person1#: It's just the cows that are grazing over there. We can milk them later. \n#Person2#: What was that? \n#Person1#: Honey, seriously, It's just a sheep. Relax! Relax, that was just the horses and donkeys that are in the stable. \n#Person2#: You know what? I don't think I can hack it here out in the countryside. I'm going back to the city! 
#Person1#: Let' s got out tomorrow night. We can go to a bar and try to find you a girlfriend. \n#Person2#: I don' t think that' s a good idea. I am just not good with approaching someone and starting up a conversation. \n#Person1#: Maybe you just need a few pick-up lines, you know, break the ice. \n#Person2#: Pick-up lines don' t work! \n#Person1#: Come on! You can just walk up to a girl and say'If you were a booger I' d pick you first. ' \n#Person2#: What? Come on! That's just lame! No girl would fall for that! \n#Person1#: Fine, then you can say, 'So there you are! I' ve been looking all over for YOU, the woman of my dreams! ' \n#Person2#: That' s a good one! I think that' s pretty funny. \n#Person1#: Yeah, so you make her laugh, you make a fool of yourself a little bit and then you buy her a drink. \n#Person2#: Ok, how does this sound, 'I was so enchanted by your beauty that I ran into that wall over there. So I am going to need your name and number for insurance purposes. ' \n#Person1#: Nice! Let' s go! 
#Person1#: God, I didn't realize. I didn't, I didn't know... \n#Person2#: ... Who you were with? I didn't know whom you were with. \n#Person1#: Excuse me? \n#Person2#: Sorry, it's from the Godfather. It's when the, when the movie producer realizes Tom Higgins had emissary of vito corleon, it's just before the horse's head ends up in the bed with all the bloody sheets, you know, wakes up, and aaah! Never mind. \n#Person1#: You were spying on me, weren't you? You probably rented those children. \n#Person2#: Why would I spy on you? \n#Person1#: Because I am your competition which you know perfectly well, or you would not put up that sign just around the corner. \n#Person2#: The entrance to our store is around the corner. And there's no other way of saying that. It's not the name of our store. It's where it is. And you do not own the phrase around the corner. \n#Person1#: What is that? What are you doing? You're taking all the caviar! That caviar is a garnish? \n#Person2#: Look, the reason I came into your store is because I was spending the day with annabell and matt. And I was buying them presents. I'm the type of guy who likes to buy his way into the hearts of children who are his relative. And there's only one place to find a children's book in the neighborhood. That will not always be the case. And it was yours. And it is a charming little bookstore. You probably sell what 350, 000 worth of books in a year. 
#Person1#: How often do you exercise? Do you play any sports?\n#Person2#: I do sports at school, that's about 3 hours every week. But that's all. I don't do any sports outside of school.\n#Person1#: Not even any cycling or walking?\n#Person2#: Very rarely. Because my mom takes me to school in the car.\n#Person1#: Did you know that doing jobs around the house like cleaning or gardening can help you lose weight?\n#Person2#: Really? I hate cleaning and gardening. If I have free time, I like reading books.\n#Person1#: What do you usually eat for breakfast and lunch?\n#Person2#: I'm usually in a hurry in the morning, so I just eat some biscuits. At lunchtime, I buy a large bag of potato chips.\n#Person1#: And what do you eat at home in the evening?\n#Person2#: Usually fish with vegetables or sometimes spaghetti.\n#Person1#: Do you often eat snacks between meals?\n#Person2#: Sometimes. I always eat a chocolate bar during my break and I often have a yogurt or an ice cream when I arrive home from school.
#Person1#: Can you give me a ride to the airport tomorrow?\n#Person2#: Depends on what time you need to be at the airport.\n#Person1#: Well, my flight leaves at 10:30 in the morning.\n#Person2#: Did you check in online already?\n#Person1#: Yes, I checked in and I don't have any bags to check.\n#Person2#: So we should leave by 9:00, so you can be there by 9:30.\n#Person1#: It's an international flight.\n#Person2#: Oh, so you need to be there 2 hours before your flight.\n#Person1#: Can you get me to the airport by 8:30?\n#Person2#: That's when I take the kids to school so I'm sorry.\n#Person1#: So how am I going to get to the airport then?\n#Person2#: Guess you'll have to pay for a cab.
#Person1#: You're watching TV again Peter.\n#Person2#: I have washed all the bowls and plates.\n#Person1#: But you haven't watered the flowers or fed the birds.\n#Person2#: I'm sorry. I forgot, I will do it now.\n#Person1#: Your dad just did that for you.\n#Person2#: Oh that was really nice of him. Well mom, I turned on the TV only because I want to know the result of the game between Manchester United and Manchester City.\n#Person1#: Why didn't you just search online?\n#Person2#: My computer isn't working.\n#Person1#: Didn't you turn it off after you finished your homework?\n#Person2#: Oh that's right. I forgot. No wonder!
#Person1#: So here are your four ticket sir, is there anything else I can do for you?\n#Person2#: Yes, I was wondering if I could get regular information about what's on?\n#Person1#: Certainly, I can add your name to our mailing list. Would that be ok?\n#Person2#: That would be very good. Yes, please. Oh, and there is something else, sorry one of our group is hard of hearing and I heard that you can supply special headphones?\n#Person1#: That's right, as long as you tell us in advance, we can always do that. I'll book those for you now, and you can just collect them here tomorrow before the show.\n#Person2#: Thanks very much for your help.\n#Person1#: No problem.

I'm interested in knowing what keeps you from joining your beloved family and staying here?\n#Person2#: Michael arranged for me to work at his uncle's institution.\n#Person1#: How much will you be paid?\n#Person2#: Judy, I don't do it for money, but for experience. Besides, it's voluntary work.\n#Person1#: You work without payment? That's really something. What kind of work is it?\n#Person2#: I'll be a teacher in one of his uncle's orphanages. When will you leave for home?\n#Person1#: Tomorrow. We'll fly to Hawaii 2 days after.\n#Person2#: Have a nice vacation.\n#Person1#: I'll send you postcards.
#Person1#: Was that the telephone ringing?\n#Person2#: I didn't hear anything.\n#Person1#: I thought I heard it ring 2 or 3 times.\n#Person2#: Sometimes when the windows are open, you can hear the neighbor's phone.\n#Person1#: Well, I'm expecting an important phone call and I don't want to miss it.
#Person1#: Excuse me, did you find a green wool scarf? I was here about 5 minutes ago.\n#Person2#: I can look.\n#Person1#: Thanks.\n#Person2#: But I only have a gray scarf here. Sorry. Where were you in the store, Sir?\n#Person1#: Well, first I was in the shoe section. Then I looked at sweaters and jackets.\n#Person2#: Just a minute. Hi. It's Sue at the register upstairs.

I like chinese chess and draughts.\n#Person1#: I ' Ve never played Chinese chess before, but I ' Ve seen old men playing it in the street.

#Person1#: Would you like me to show you our new cleaning unit? It's a clever design.\n#Person2#: Yes, I'd like to see that. What does it clean exactly?\n#Person1#: It washes the solvent off all the metal parts - the blades, trays etc. - and then sends it back into the system.\n#Person2#: What does the unit consist of?\n#Person1#: Well, it's basically two tanks, one for the dirty solvent and one for the clean solvent, a pump and a washing unit.

#Person1#: Have we sold out all the newspapers for today?\n#Person2#: Yes. What a good job we have done!\n#Person1#: Why are so many extra gifts left here?\n#Person2#: Many customers didn't want them.\n#Person1#: How about giving them to that old man?\n#Person2#: Good idea.\n#Person1#: By the way, do you think it's a good idea to give free gifts to attract customers?\n#Person2#: I'm not sure, but still it did attract a large crowds today.\n#Person1#: I think it should be more useful to hand out some fliers which is also cheaper.\n#Person2#: But people can just throw them into the trash can as they turn around.\n#Person1#: That's true.\n#Person2#: Anyway, let's just finish out job and get back home.\n#Person1#: Okay. How tiring the job is!

Actually, weekends tend to be the most hectic day in the whole week.\n#Person2#: I really hope that I could sleep like a log all through two nights. But. . . Some one said that weekends are a bit like rainbows ; they look good from a distance but disappear before we get up close to them.\n#Person1#: I couldn't agree more.
#Person1#: Tom! How are you? We missed you at the party last night. Are you OK?\n#Person2#: I don't know. I didn't really feel like going out. I guess I'm feeling a little homesick.\n#Person1#: Come on. We'Ve been through this already! Look, I know the adjustment was hard when you first got here, but we agreed that you were gonna try and deal with it.\n#Person2#: I was. It's just that the holidays are coming up and I won't be able to home because I can't afford the airfare. I'm just longing for some of the comforts of home, like my mom's cooking and being around my family.\n#Person1#: Yeah, it can get pretty lonely over the holidays. When I first got here, I'd get depressed and nostalgic for anything that reminded me of home. I almost let it get to me, but then I started going out, keeping myself busy and before I knew it, I was used to to it.\n#Person2#: I see what you mean, but I'm still bummed out.\n#Person1#: OK. how does this sound. let's get you suited up and hit the dance club tonight.

Will you try it on?\n#Person1#: Yes, I will. But how much is it?\n#Person2#: Only 700 yuan.\n#Person1#: It's expensive for me.\n#Person2#: How about this one?

#Person1#: What do you like to do in your spare time?\n#Person2#: I like to be with people. Last weekend I went to a Japanese friend's place. What about you?\n#Person1#: I like spending time in my room, reading, writing and thinking.\n#Person2#: Oh, I just remembered something important. You said you like writing, right? Could you write an article about what you saw and heard in London? You can write whatever you like.\n#Person1#: You really want to read my article?\n#Person2#: Not me, an editor of a magazine wants to read it.\n#Person1#: Who is the editor?\n#Person2#: My father. He recently discovered that you just got back from studying English in England. He would like to hear your views on British culture.\n#Person1#: Thank you and your father. I will try my best. But, you know, my English is poor...\n#Person2#: Don't worry. My father will help you correct it.
#Person1#: Hi, Ms. Rowling, how old were you when you started to write? And what was your first book?\n#Person2#: I wrote my first book when I about six. It was about a small tiger. And I've been writing ever since.\n#Person1#: Why did you choose to be an author?\n#Person2#: Well, if you want to achieve happiness, step one would be finding out what you love doing most. Step two would be finding someone to pay you to do this. I consider myself very lucky to be able to support myself by writing.\n#Person1#: Do you have any plans to write books for adults?\n#Person2#: I suppose I might write one. But I never really imagine a target audience when I'm writing. The ideas come first. So it really depends on the ideas that grasp me next.\n#Person1#: Where did the ideas for the Harry Potter books come from?\n#Person2#: I've no idea where the ideas came from. And I hope I'll never find out. It would spoil my excitement.
#Person1#: Let's see. That's two pairs of trousers, one lady's dress and one man's overcoat.\n#Person2#: And this sports shirt too, all cleaned and ironed.

Any time after four o'clock.\n#Person2#: How late are you open?\n#Person1#: Until 9 o'clock in the evening, sir.\n#Person2#: Fine. That leaves me plenty of time to pick it up after work.\n#Person1#: OK. You can come for the coat any time after 4 o, clock.\n#Person2#: Good. Thank you.
#Person1#: Excuse me, Is there an airline flying to New York this afternoon?\n#Person2#: Sorry, sir. I can't sell you a ticket. Our computer is down.\n#Person1#: If your computer is down, just write me a ticket.\n#Person2#: Sorry, I can't. The computer is the only one allowed doing so.\n#Person1#: Hmm... Then what do all you people do?\n#Person2#: We give the computer the information about your trip, and then it tells us whether you can fly with us or not.\n#Person1#: So when it goes down, you go down with it.\n#Person2#: I am truly sorry, sir. But there is nothing I can do.\n#Person1#: How long will the computer be down?\n#Person2#: Sorry, I've got no idea. Sometimes it's down for 10 minutes; sometimes for two hours. There's no way we can find out without asking the computer, and since it's down, it won't answer us.\n#Person1#: Well, let's forget the computer. Is there any other airline flying to New York within the next few hours?\n#Person2#: I wouldn't know. Only the computer knows. It just can't tell me.
#Person1#: Hi, Gary. How handsome you are in the blue coat!\n#Person2#: Thank you. I'm very glad to hear that.\n#Person1#: I like your new coat very much. Where did you get it?\n#Person2#: Well, I got it from the department store where there are many clothes, from shirt to skirt, from jacket to coat.\n#Person1#: Oh. I know that store. Clothes there are expensive for me. How much did it cost you?\n#Person2#: Not as much as the saleswoman asked for. She wanted $90.\n#Person1#: So. how much did you pay for it in the end?\n#Person2#: I tried to make her bring down to half the price.\n#Person1#: Wow! How smart you are! In fact, I have been attracted by a cool hat in that store for a long time. Can you help me bring its price down?\n#Person2#: I'm not sure, but I can have a try.\n#Person1#: Then, thank you very much.
#Person1#: Did you have any kind of punishment in your life and studies? \n#Person2#: Yes, just once. \n#Person1#: What was the reason? \n#Person2#: I once played truant when I was in college because I intended to organize a donation activity for the disaster-hit areas in Sichuan. 
#Person1#: I have to do some shopping. \n#Person2#: What are you going to look for? \n#Person1#: I'm trying to buy a new bedroom set. \n#Person2#: What store are you going to? \n#Person1#: I'm not sure. \n#Person2#: You don't know? \n#Person1#: I have no idea where to find one. \n#Person2#: Would you like me to tell you where I got mine. \n#Person1#: I would appreciate that. \n#Person2#: I went to get mine from IKEA. \n#Person1#: Is the furniture at IKEA cheap? \n#Person2#: They're not cheap, but neither is their furniture. 
#Person1#: hey, Lily, what are you doing? \n#Person2#: waiting for someone. \n#Person1#: you mean the boy you met on MSN? \n#Person2#: you're right. He is so funny and I think I'm in love with him. \n#Person1#: you must be joking. You can't fall in love with someone you've never met! \n#Person2#: I know, but I keep thinking of him every day. And I get really depressed when he's not online. \n#Person1#: I think it's just a crush. You can't be serious. \n#Person2#: well, this might be silly. But I just can't get him off my mind. And I can't help missing him. \n#Person1#: did you tell him? \n#Person2#: yes. He said I'm his dream girl. \n#Person1#: you shouldn't take it too seriously. It might be a lie. \n#Person2#: I know. I can't tell whether he's serious or not so I need your advice. \n#Person1#: I think you should enlarge your circle of real life friends, and then the right person will come along. 
#Person1#: Gordon, you're ever so late. \n#Person2#: Yes, I am sorry. I missed the bus. \n#Person1#: But there's a bus every ten minutes, and you are over an hour late. \n#Person2#: Well, I missed several buses. \n#Person1#: How on earth can you miss several buses? \n#Person2#: I, ah. . . , I got up late. \n#Person1#: Oh, come on, Gordon, it's the afternoon now. Why were you late really? \n#Person2#: Well, I. . . I lost my wallet, and I. . . \n#Person1#: Have you got it now? \n#Person2#: Yes, I found it again. \n#Person1#: When? \n#Person2#: This morning. I mean. . . \n#Person1#: I am not convinced by your explanation. 
#Person1#: Make yourself at home.My house is always open to you. \n#Person2#: I've been looking forward to seeing you. \n#Person1#: Would you care for a drink? \n#Person2#: Just a cup of soda for me,please. \n#Person1#: What are you going to do next month? \n#Person2#: I'm thinking of going to Europe. \n#Person1#: Oh,really? And what are you going to do there? \n#Person2#: Oh,I think I'll just travel around for a while \n#Person1#: Lucky you! 
#Person1#: Why do you want to be a teacher? \n#Person2#: It's a job I have been dreaming of for many years. While it is difficult, I am convinced that there is nothing more noble and rewarding than this profession. \n#Person1#: Do you know about our school? \n#Person2#: Yes, a little. I know your school is one of the best known in this town. There are about 200 children in the school. 
#Person1#: I am having a hard time at my job. \n#Person2#: What's wrong, Julia? \n#Person1#: My colleagues quickly get promotions, while I always get sidelined. I don't know what to do anymore. \n#Person2#: Don't give up so soon. \n#Person1#: But I don't know what else I can do. I am willing to work hard. Sometimes I make mistakes and the boss is not happy. \n#Person2#: Mistakes are just a lessons to learn from. \n#Person1#: Tell that to my boss. \n#Person2#: Do you know Abraham Lincoln? \n#Person1#: Yes. \n#Person2#: He grew up poor in Kentucky and barely had a year of schooling, but he went on to become the President of United States. \n#Person1#: He was also assassinated because of his views. \n#Person2#: He is known as American's greatest president. Do you know why? Because he fought against slavery and secession at a time in history where others were too afraid to do anything. He succeeded because of his ambition and generous spirit. \n#Person1#: Well, if he can become president, then I can at least get a promotion. \n#Person2#: That's the spirit. Never give up on your dream. 
#Person1#: Are you studying any languages here? \n#Person2#: Yes, I'm studying in the Foreign Languages Department. \n#Person1#: What are you majoring in? \n#Person2#: I'm majoring in English. \n#Person1#: Is it difficult to learn? \n#Person2#: Yes. The language is hard to learn, but it's interesting. \n#Person1#: Do you know anything about Britain and America? \n#Person2#: I'm reading a lot of books about the two countries. I like the culture. \n#Person1#: Right. It's important to learn the culture of a nation if you want to learn the language well. \n#Person2#: You're right. 
#Person1#: How was your doctors' appointment?\n#Person2#: It was fine. He says that I'm pretty healthy overall. But I told him that I have trouble sleeping sometimes and he offered me sleeping pills.\n#Person1#: Did you take them?\n#Person2#: No, I'm afraid they're harmful to my health.\n#Person1#: So what are you going to do?\n#Person2#: I think I will schedule an appointment with the psychologist. Maybe I can't sleep because I have too much anxiety. Talking to someone may help.\n#Person1#: You know I used to have trouble sleeping and I found a few things that help. If I exercise outdoors in the morning, it relaxes me all day. Also, if I don't use my phone or computer after 8:00 pm, then I can easily fall asleep at 10.\n#Person2#: Those are good suggestions. Maybe I should try those things before I pay to see a psychologist.\n#Person1#: Yeah, you might as well try.

Which do you prefer?\n#Person1#: I will fly out of whatever airport with the cheapest price.\n#Person2#: If you have a choice, would you rather fly in the morning or later in the day?\n#Person1#: I would like to book an afternoon flight.\n#Person2#: I have booked you a flight in the afternoon, your ticket will arrive in the mail, within 3 days.
#Person1#: Hi, where are you working now?\n#Person2#: In a clothing factory, but I'm trying to find another job.\n#Person1#: Really, why?\n#Person2#: You know, I've been working there for more than 6 years, but I can't even buy a house.\n#Person1#: But do you like the job and the people?\n#Person2#: Yes, of course. The job is nice and the people are nice too.\n#Person1#: Well, if you like the job, I suggest that you apply for a loan.\n#Person2#: But applying for a loan is complicated, isn't it?\n#Person1#: Absolutely not, but you must consider 3 things.\n#Person2#: What are they?\n#Person1#: The interest rate, the banks reputation and the loan term. Choose a bank with the best service and the lowest interest.\n#Person2#: Oh, it's such a good idea. Thanks a lot.
#Person1#: I wrote this song last night. I've been feeling very creative lately.\n#Person2#: It was interesting. I've never heard a song about bees before.\n#Person1#: I was just thinking about these last night and how they buzz around the flowers. I had to pick up my guitar and start composing.\n#Person2#: I bet you have a lot of other songs.\n#Person1#: Oh yeah, I wrote one about the ocean the other day. And I have others about socks, my mom, picking apples and tons of other things. I think I'm going to put them all on an album.\n#Person2#: Good idea.\n#Person1#: Maybe I will get really famous and go on tour. Want to be in my band?\n#Person2#: Well, my style is really different from yours. Your songs are so happy and light.\n#Person1#: I have some sad songs, too. We would make a really good team I think.

I know that she prefers red and yellow. She likes diamonds. But I think she would also like a ruby or something else that's really bright.\n#Person1#: We have some gorgeous ruby rings over here. Does she like silver or gold?\n#Person2#: Gold.\n#Person1#: This one here is really nice. The gold band is on the thinner side.\n#Person2#: I like that one. Do you have anything with a smaller stone?\n#Person1#: This one here has a small stone. There was a nice design on the band, too.\n#Person2#: I think this may be the one. I'm going to send a photo of it to my mom.

Every weekend different students would invite me to their places, and we would have a great time.
#Person1#: What is the schedule for tomorrow?\n#Person2#: Let me see, a meeting with bill lines at 10:00 in the morning and all the paperwork is ready, and then a trip to the national lab at 3:00 in the afternoon and at 7:00 in the evening we'll have dinner with Mr. Cooper manager of LG company.\n#Person1#: Another busy day, but please don't plan anything for Saturday.

#Person1#: Lucy, I ' d like to fix the light in the corridor, it keeps flashing, which drives me crazy. Would you like to help me with the ladder?\n#Person2#: Monica, wait a moment. I think we ' d better call the repair man to do it.\n#Person1#: I think I can handle it by myself.\n#Person2#: I ' d like you to have a look at the safety manual of our company.\n#Person1#: I see.

#Person1#: Hi, Becky, what's up?\n#Person2#: Not much, except that my mother-in-law is driving me up the wall.\n#Person1#: What's the problem?\n#Person2#: She loves to nit-pick and criticizes everything that I do. I can never do anything right when she ' s around.\n#Person1#: For example?\n#Person2#: Well, last week I invited her over to dinner. My husband and I had no problem with the food, but if you listened to her, then it would seem like I fed her old meat and rotten vegetables. There's just nothing can please her.\n#Person1#: No, I can't see that happening. I know you're a good cook and nothing like that would ever happen.\n#Person2#: It's not just that. She also criticizes how we raise the kids.\n#Person1#: My mother-in-law used to do the same thing to us. If it wasn't disciplining them enough, then we were disciplining them too much. She also complained about the food we fed them, the schools we sent them too, and everything else under the sun.
#Person1#: Do you take a bus to and from work?\n#Person2#: Yeah, everyday. And there ' s only one choice. All the other buses are going the other direction.\n#Person1#: Hmm. I have the same problem. When I leave work, it ' s always rush hour. So the buses are always crowded.\n#Person2#: Oh, yeah, it ' s terrible. I will tell you the funniest thing I have seen in China. It ' s when so many people try to get onto one city bus, and the last guy is squeezed in so tight that the door is tightly pressed against his butt.\n#Person1#: That sounds terrible the way you describe it. But you know, not long ago I really suffered on the bus.\n#Person2#: What happened? Were you having a hard time getting on a bus?\n#Person1#: You just can ' t imagine! I waited for the first bus but it was too full, so I waited for the second, and it was still very crowded. Then I decided not to wait for the next one, and got on the second bus. It was so full that I had to stand on one foot! No kidding!\n#Person2#: Hmm. Good exercise, uh?\n#Person1#: Yeah, absolutely!\n#Person2#: And it ' s so much fun. One day, the bodies were so tightly packed that some girl ' s behind was pressed against my front. I was afraid to put my hands down for fear of accidentally groping her.\n#Person1#: You were so happy, weren ' t you?\n#Person2#: What do you think? I ' m a good boy.

We'll start from the Folk Collection Exhibition House, a multi-folk collection exhibition hall, where the best of local antique objects are on constant display. The hall itself used to be the site of a local club in the late King Dynasty, a well preserved piece of antique architecture itself. Academic research seminars and exchanges between domestic and international experts are often organized there.\n#Person2#: Very interesting. That's really a place I must go and see. And then?\n#Person1#: If you have interest in butterflies, you must go to the Butterfly Exhibition. Mr. Chen, owner of the private museum, has a large collection of specimen of over 1 000 species of butterflies from more than 20 countries for public display. Quite a lot of them are state-level treasures.\n#Person2#: Mr. Chen himself has become an authority in this area, and master of butterfly sample making, I should say.

I think everyone should go easy on driving.

#Person1#: Hello, is this the ABC Company? \n#Person2#: Yes. May I help you? \n#Person1#: We have just arrived from Tokyo and we've been looking for our reserved car of your company all over, but we cannot find it. \n#Person2#: What is your reservation number? \n#Person1#: Our reservation number is J-221. \n#Person2#: Let me see. Oh, yes. We have your reservation number. \n#Person1#: You mean you haven't arranged any car. \n#Person2#: I'm sorry to say 'No. ' \n#Person1#: Here, I'll take a taxi instead. How do you refund us? 
#Person1#: Thanks for coming shopping with me. \n#Person2#: I'm so honored that you thought to ask me. \n#Person1#: I've never given a speech in front of a thousand people before. \n#Person2#: You're going to do great. And you're going to look great. \n#Person1#: Thanks. Now let's decide which one of these suits looks best for this occasion. \n#Person2#: I still like the olive one best. There's a tailor here who can take up the sleeves for you. \n#Person1#: The question is, can he have it done before Friday? \n#Person2#: These guys are professional. I think they can have it done tomorrow. Let's ask. 
#Person1#: Steven, would you like to go dance with us tonight? \n#Person2#: John, I am just not in the mood for this. \n#Person1#: You look so upset. What's going on? \n#Person2#: I lost the table tennis game yesterday. \n#Person1#: Oh, what a pity! \n#Person2#: I just don't want to play table tennis any more. \n#Person1#: Is it that bad? It's nothing more than a game. \n#Person2#: My opponent bowled me with the very first ball. I was wondering if it's appropriate for me to play table tennis. \n#Person1#: Oh, come on! Failure is the mother of success. Don't lose heart. I'm sure you'll succeed. \n#Person2#: Perhaps you are right. But I still need some time to recover from the failure. \n#Person1#: I understand. 
#Person1#: What are you going to do for your year abroad, Tim? \n#Person2#: Study study study! I want to learn a lot. \n#Person1#: You're going to take courses? \n#Person2#: Yes, I'm going to take some university courses there. \n#Person1#: Sounds hard. \n#Person2#: Yes, but I think it's probably for the best. \n#Person1#: Won't you get lonely? \n#Person2#: Hey, I'm a pretty cool guy; I'll make friends. And I'll have a lot of extra-curricular activities too. You know, like fencing or theater or something. 
#Person1#: I was thinking of starting my own business. I know you wanted me to take over your restaurant business but I can't stand working in the food industry.\n#Person2#: OK, but what do you really want to do?\n#Person1#: I want to sell skateboards, clothing and shoes.\n#Person2#: You want to run a clothing shop?\n#Person1#: No, it's actually a skateboarding shop.\n#Person2#: What would make your shop different from all the others?\n#Person1#: I thought we could make our own T-shirts. Maybe you and dad could lend me some money first.\n#Person2#: Sounds OK to me, but you'll have to talk to your dad about this too.
#Person1#: Hey, Peter. I'm sorry.\n#Person2#: Hi, Diana. What's wrong?\n#Person1#: We were going to Hong Kong this weekend. But I'm afraid I can't go.\n#Person2#: How come?\n#Person1#: I have a really big geography test and I have to study for it.\n#Person2#: We can go next weekend instead?\n#Person1#: No, I don't want to ruin your weekend. You go ahead and please take the book I bought to my friend Sally. Tell her I have to study all weekend, because I can't afford to fail the test.\n#Person2#: OK, then I'll go with them. But it's a pity you can't come.
#Person1#: Good morning. What can I do for you?\n#Person2#: I am looking for a flat for 2 people near the university.\n#Person1#: Well. There are several places available and the rent ranges from 80 to $150 a month. What are your requirements?\n#Person2#: I think of flat for no more than $100 a month is good. I prefer to live in a quiet street and I need at least 2 bedrooms.\n#Person1#: Well, we have got 2 flats that meet your requirements. This one costs $85 a month, it's 2 miles away from the university.\n#Person2#: Well. That's a little far to walk. What about the other one?\n#Person1#: The second one is 3/2 miles away from the university, but it is smaller and more expensive. It's $100 a month.\n#Person2#: Can we go to have a look at the second one now? I want to examine the room before making a final decision.\n#Person1#: No problem, but please wait for 5 minutes. I need to finish typing this piece of material.\n#Person2#: OK.
#Person1#: I like that picture you put up on the wall yesterday.\n#Person2#: Oh, thank you. It's a photograph that I took on my vacation last year.\n#Person1#: You took it yourself? I didn't know you were a photographer.\n#Person2#: Oh yes, I've been taking pictures for years.\n#Person1#: It sounds interesting! Do you have anymore of your pictures here and may I see them?\n#Person2#: Yes, certainly! Some of them are faces, just faces of People whom I see what I'm walking around.\n#Person1#: Do you let them know that you're taking pictures of them?\n#Person2#: I try not to? I don't like pictures of People who set themselves for the Camera. I like People who are going about their business without knowing the cameras there.\n#Person1#: I suppose you need a lot of equipment. How many cameras do you have? Well I have a dozen of them, but I use two of them more than the others.
#Person1#: Darling, I'm going to stop by Bergner's first. It's got some quality stuff. Who knows, some of their dresses might be on sale.\n#Person2#: Bergner's?\n#Person1#: It's a fairly well known store like Penny's. I need to get something for Lisa's birthday. She's into name brands. Any suggestions?\n#Person2#: A Gucci handbag or Calvin Klein T-shirt might be nice. Oh, I have a 15% discount card for Penny's. Let's go ahead and use it. Here it is.\n#Person1#: It's wonderful. We can save some money for our home. Oh no, I was supposed to give Helen a call in hour ago. It's already 4:45. I left my phone with her. She must be still waiting for my call.\n#Person2#: Use my phone, darling.\n#Person1#: OK. Is my telephone number 61199621?\n#Person2#: Oh my God! You still don't remember it. It's 61299621. Only the last number is different from mine. Mine is 2.\n#Person1#: Don't blame me. I have changed it for only 3 days.\n#Person2#: OK, you should write it down on your notebook.
#Person1#: Oh, Eric. Could you please turn the TV off? I'm trying to study.\n#Person2#: Oh, come on. I've just got home from work. I need to relax.\n#Person1#: That's not the point. You don't have to relax with the sound so loud.\n#Person2#: Well, do you mind closing your bedroom door? So I won't have to turn the TV off.\n#Person1#: No, sorry, I can't. The door is broken, no remember?\n#Person2#: OK. I'll turn the TV off now, but I want to watch my favorite program in an hour.\n#Person1#: Sure, no problem.
#Person1#: Mom! I hate eating vegetables!\n#Person2#: You don ' t have to eat them. I don ' t mind.\n#Person1#: Thanks mom! Can I have dessert now? I love chocolate cake!\n#Person2#: No dessert for you unless you eat all your vegetables.\n#Person1#: But I don ' t like them! It ' s not fair!\n#Person2#: You can have some fruit for dessert. If you eat an apple and a banana, I might let you have a small piece of chocolate cake.\n#Person1#: Ok... actually, I don ' t mind eating peas and carrots, buy I hate broccoli and cauliflower.\n#Person2#: I ' ll remember that for next time. You ' ll get extra peas and carrots, buy no broccoli or cauliflower. OK?\n#Person1#: Thanks mom!
#Person1#: This is our rock-bottom price, Mr. Lee.\n#Person2#: If that's the case. there's not much point in further discussion. We might as well call the whole deal off.\n#Person1#: What I mean is that we'll never be able to come down to your price. The gap is too great.\n#Person2#: I think it unwise for either of us to be inflexible. How about meeting each other halfway?\n#Person1#: What's your proposal?\n#Person2#: Your unit price is 100 dollars higher than we want. Well, I suggest we meet each other halfway.\n#Person1#: Do you mean a further reduction of 50 dollars in our price? That's impossible!\n#Person2#: What would you suggest?\n#Person1#: The best we can do is another 30 dollars off. That's definitely the lowest we can go.\n#Person2#: That still leaves a gap of 20 dollars. Let's meet each other half-away again and split the difference ; I think this is a price we can both be satisfied with.\n#Person1#: OK. We can meet halfway again.
#Person1#: Good morning, Ms. Chan. What can I get you today?\n#Person2#: Good morning, Mr. Church. I'd like some lamb chops for the children's lunch.\n#Person1#: Shoulder chops, Ms. Chan?\n#Person2#: Yes. I'll take four shoulder chops and I'd like a small chicken.\n#Person1#: Would you like to choose a chicken?\n#Person2#: Which one is cheaper?\n#Person1#: This one is our cheapest.\n#Person2#: How much is all that? I don't have much cash. Can I give you a check?\n#Person1#: Yes, of course, Ms. Chan.
#Person1#: Hi, boss. You wanted to see me?\n#Person2#: Zina. Look, I know when I hired you, I told you I'd pay you a salary. But I just can't.\n#Person1#: Excuse me? I hope I didn't just hear what I think I just heard.\n#Person2#: I know it's awkward, but you're going to be thanking me later. I'm going to make you rich.\n#Person1#: You're going to make me rich by not paying me?
#Person1#: Hello, is Jack there?\n#Person2#: Speaking.\n#Person1#: Jack! It's Rose here.\n#Person2#: Hi, Rose. How's everything?\n#Person1#: Fine, thanks. I'm having several friends over for dinner this Saturday. And I was wondering if you have the time to join us.\n#Person2#: Sounds good. What time do you want me to come?\n#Person1#: Is six o'clock okay?
#Person1#: How do you like this waltz?\n#Person2#: It's very nice, I like it very much.\n#Person1#: Well, then, may I invite you for the first dance?\n#Person2#: My pleasure. But I'm afraid I'm not much of a dancer, and I suppose you dance often.\n#Person1#: Me? Oh, no. In fact, I took up dancing quite recently.\n#Person2#: Oh, really? But you're doing the waltz wonderfully well.\n#Person1#: I'm glad you say so, you dance beautifully too. It's lucky that I got a partner.\n#Person2#: Thank you for your compliments. It's just that you are a good leader. Do you like the fox-trot and tango?\n#Person1#: Yes. And what dances do you do best?\n#Person2#: Disco is my favorite. I like it better than any other dances because it can release one's pent-up feelings, and is a healthy exercise. But I don't do the rock and roll and the break dance.\n#Person1#: Oh, well, the music has stopped. Thank you for the dance.\n#Person2#: My pleasure. Let's go and have a drink.\n#Person1#: Fine.
#Person1#: Here's your drink, sir.\n#Person2#: No, that's not right. I didn't order a coffee. I ordered a cola.\n#Person1#: Oh, I'm terribly sorry, sir. I'll go and get you cola right away.\n#Person2#: Waiter!\n#Person1#: Yes, sir. I'll bring your drink right away.\n#Person2#: It's not that. There's an animal in my soup.\n#Person1#: Is there, sir? I'm very sorry. I'll change it straight away.\n#Person2#: I've never been to such a dirty restaurant, and never seen such slow service.\n#Person1#: I'm really sorry.
#Person1#: Good morning, Mary!\n#Person2#: Good morning, John!\n#Person1#: I want to have a few friends over for a dinner party to celebrate my birthday. Would you be able to come the next weekend on Saturday?\n#Person2#: I'd be delighted to, John. Saturday did you say?\n#Person1#: Yes, if that's all right for you.\n#Person2#: I'm pretty sure I'll be all right. In fact, I'd be delighted to come over and celebrate your birthday with you. What time are you planning to start?\n#Person1#: Oh, good. If you could come around six thirty or seven o'clock, that would give us some time to chat a whit over a glass of wine before dinner.\n#Person2#: That sounds fine. I'll be there around seven.
#Person1#: What did you think of the movie?\n#Person2#: I didn't like it. Not a bit. I couldn't stand the music. Besides the story was so boring that it put me to sleep.\n#Person1#: I noticed that, it was not exciting as I expected, but the music was great. I'm always found Jazz. And that movie had a lot of Jazz.\n#Person2#: I know. However, Jazz always annoys me. I really don't enjoy music in a movie.\n#Person1#: I'm sorry to hear that. What kind of movie do you like?\n#Person2#: Anything with a lot of action, I like thrillers and chillers.\n#Person1#: Oh, I see.\n#Person2#: Well, I enjoy the popcorn and being with you. You're more important than the movie.\n#Person1#: Thanks for the sweet words.\n#Person2#: Any time.
#Person1#: Lodge, You must come around sometime, You have to check out my mew stereo.\n#Person2#: Sure, When is good time for you?\n#Person1#: Can you make it on Tuesday?\n#Person2#: What time do you want me there?\n#Person1#: Anytime after six will be fine.\n#Person2#: All right, It's a date.
#Person1#: Hi, I'm Jake. I'm new to the choir. What's your name?\n#Person2#: Hello, there, my name is Tonia.\n#Person1#: Do you sing alto?\n#Person2#: Actually, I can do both soprano and alto but the director asked me to sing alto for the next perforate. What about you.\n#Person1#: Looks like we both float back and forth. I'm baritone.\n#Person2#: Our bass section is really good. You're going to love singing with them.\n#Person1#: I heard them warming up earlier. You're right.\n#Person2#: It's good to have you in the group. We can always use a good baritone!
#Person1#: Hey! I have a surprise for you.\n#Person2#: What is it?\n#Person1#: Open this card and read.\n#Person2#: A trip to China for summer vacation. Wow! What a wonderful surprise! Thank you. This is the best surprise I've ever had.
#Person1#: Hi, sir. Come and have a look here. We have all kinds of sweaters.\n#Person2#: I'm looking for a sweater for my wife. Tomorrow is her birthday. And I know she needs a woolen sweater.\n#Person1#: How do you like this grey one? It's pure wool, one hundred percent of Xinjiang wool.\n#Person2#: It feels good. Are there cowl-neck pullovers with the same color? My wife prefers a turtleneck to a V-shaped collar.\n#Person1#: Yes, we do. What size do you want?\n#Person2#: Size one. By the way, what if I bring home this sweater and my wife doesn't like it?\n#Person1#: Well, you can always bring it back to us for a full refund.\n#Person2#: All right. Could I have it gift-wrapped, please?\n#Person1#: Yes, just a moment, please.
#Person1#: Hello. Can I help you, ma'am?\n#Person2#: Yes. Could you tell me how to send some money to someone with an account with a bank in Germany?\n#Person1#: Well, you can pay by mail, telegraphic or SWIFT transfer. Or you can have a banker's draft and mail it yourself to the beneficiary.\n#Person2#: Which is the best way?\n#Person1#: It depends on the amount and how fast you want that person to receive the money. A SWIFT transfer is the fastest method but a banker's draft is usually the cheapest. How much do you wanna send?\n#Person2#: $ 800.\n#Person1#: Why don't you send it by mail payment order?\n#Person2#: How long does it take?\n#Person1#: About a week.\n#Person2#: I don't know. Can I send it more quickly?\n#Person1#: Sure. You can have a Telegraphic or a SWIFT transfer.\n#Person2#: And how long do those take?\n#Person1#: Both a Telegraphic Transfer and a SWIFT transfer will normally be credited to the payee's account within three or four working days, depending on whether the beneficiary's bank is among our correspondent banks or we have to route the transfer through a third bank.\n#Person2#: I see. How can I pay by Telegraphic Transfer?\n#Person1#: You have to fill out this form, ma'am.
#Person1#: Where did you get assigned to go this time around?\n#Person2#: They asked me to go to Paris to check on the new office that was just established there. And you?\n#Person1#: Hong Kong again. I would like to go somewhere different for a change.\n#Person2#: Teach me Cantonese and I'll pull some strings to get a trade with you next time around.\n#Person1#: If you really want to learn, remind me when you get back from your business trip.\n#Person2#: You're on.\n#Person1#: When do you leave?\n#Person2#: I'm scheduled to fly out on the tenth.
#Person1#: Good afternoon, you look a little stuck. Can I help?\n#Person2#: The thing is, I've got all of this information here, all of these leaflets, but I can't make head nor tail of them!\n#Person1#: I see. What is it exactly that you are interested in?\n#Person2#: I'm not sure which would be better for me ; buying some insurance or putting my money in a Savings Deposit.\n#Person1#: Well, that all depends on how much you want to invest.\n#Person2#: I was thinking of around 10, 000 RIB.\n#Person1#: That's a nice round figure to deal with! OK, if you were to buy this insurance policy, your yearly fixed income from it would be 94. 35 RIB.\n#Person2#: And for the Savings Deposit?\n#Person1#: For the Savings Deposit you could actually get more. You see, in time deposit, the interest rate is 1. 58 % after the 20 % interest tax. So, technically you could get more than a third more.\n#Person2#: Wow! A third more? Very good.
#Person1#: Hello sir, may I help you?\n#Person2#: Yeah, I accidentally dropped my phone in the toilet.\n#Person1#: I see. Well, you have come to the right place. We have over one hundred models of more than twenty leading mobile phone manufacturers.\n#Person2#: Sounds good. I don't want it to be too expensive, maybe something mid-range.\n#Person1#: We have this new ETC smart phone. It comes with the Android OS so you can download applications. It also has a built-in camera, mp3 player and touch screen. It works on the 3G network so you have fast access to the internet wherever you are.\n#Person2#: What about Wi-fi?\n#Person1#: Of course! You can access the internet from any hotspot as well as from home.\n#Person2#: One last thing. Is it waterproof?
#Person1#: Well, my particular interest is collecting stamps, especially the rare ones. What about you?\n#Person2#: I'm afraid that's not my cup of tea. I just find skin-diving attracting.\n#Person1#: So have you ever been to the stamp display of the town?
#Person1#: What did you do at the office today?\n#Person2#: I had a really busy day. I had to work a little overtime. In the morning an important client called to place a large order. I had to check some things with my colleagues before confirming the order.\n#Person1#: What kind of things did you need to check?\n#Person2#: The most important thing was to check that we had the goods in stock. If the goods are in stock, we can deliver them immediately. I also had to check the price. This customer is very important, so they get special prices.\n#Person1#: I see. Did anything else happen?\n#Person2#: I received a lot of emails from potential clients that I had to answer. Each time, I had to check files to see what we had agreed at earlier meetings. Each client has different conditions and requirements.\n#Person1#: It must be difficult to remember the details for each individual client.\n#Person2#: Yes. That's why we have everything on computer files. We don't use much paper at our office. After lunch, I had to deal with a complaint from a client.\n#Person1#: I hate dealing with complaints. Was it a legitimate complaint?\n#Person2#: Yes, it was. I managed to sort out the problem, but I was tied up with the matter for over an hour.\n#Person1#: You certainly had a busy day.\n#Person2#: That's not all! I also had to finish writing a sales report for my boss. In the end, I finished everything. I wonder what will be waiting for me tomorrow morning.
#Person1#: Good morning. Welcome to Time After Time Watches.\n#Person2#: I'd like to buy a watch.\n#Person1#: Well, you've come to the right place. What kind of watch are you looking for?\n#Person2#: Well, I'm not sure. Let's see. How much is this one?\n#Person1#: Hmm. . . This Rolex? $ 1, 000.\n#Person2#: Oh. I don't think I can afford that. How about this one?\n#Person1#: This one is $ 500.\n#Person2#: Wow. That's too much for me. Don't you have anything cheaper?
#Person1#: Bob, did you see our supervisor? I need him to sign this paper.\n#Person2#: He is in his office, but you'd better choose your words carefully while talking to him.\n#Person1#: What's up?\n#Person2#: Nothing. But he is in a bad mood today.\n#Person1#: Thanks for the warning.\n#Person2#: That's all right.
#Person1#: Did you enjoy the restaurant?\n#Person2#: I didn't really like it all that much.\n#Person1#: What do you think the problem was?\n#Person2#: Well, they are pretty new. I just didn't feel that they were ready to open yet.\n#Person1#: How did you feel about the food?\n#Person2#: The food wasn't all that exciting.\n#Person1#: I don't think that the service was good, either.\n#Person2#: Yes, the service certainly didn't add to the experience.\n#Person1#: Would you like to return to this restaurant?\n#Person2#: Maybe we could try it again in a few months when things have settled down.
#Person1#: You're making my blood boil.\n#Person2#: Calm down. Madam.\n#Person1#: I'm about to explode! You'Ve made a mess of this matter.\n#Person2#: I am very sorry to hear that you'Ve been having so many problems.\n#Person1#: Sorry isn't good enough! What can you do to help me?\n#Person2#: I understand why you're angry, Mrs. Wilson, and believe me, we are doing everything in our power to work this out.\n#Person1#: Well, obviously, what you're doing is not good enough!\n#Person2#: If you could just give us a few more days, we should be able to get this straightened out.
#Person1#: How have you been doing lately?\n#Person2#: Actually, I haven't been sleeping well. I am kind of out of it.\n#Person1#: Is there some reason why you can't get enough sleep?\n#Person2#: I go to bed, but I just can't get comfortable enough to stay asleep.\n#Person1#: When do you turn in for the night?\n#Person2#: I usually try to go to bed around 11\n#Person1#: Do you have a lot on your mind when you try to go to sleep?\n#Person2#: My mother is ill with cancer, and I think about her a lot.\n#Person1#: Do you ever meditate or read before bedtime?\n#Person2#: I usually watch a lot of television before I go to bed. Maybe I should try something else to help me quiet down.
#Person1#: My amenities bill says that I owe $ 10 for a movie, but I never ordered one.\n#Person2#: Let's see. It says that you were charged Monday at 9:00 p. m. for the movie'Titanic. '\n#Person1#: That's absolutely wrong! I was out exploring the city Monday night.\n#Person2#: Okay, let me see what I can do for you.\n#Person1#: Thank you. I didn't think it would be this simple.\n#Person2#: I can take the $ 10 off your bill, but I need to charge you $ 2 for the service.\n#Person1#: Are you serious? I have to pay $ 2 for a movie I never watched?\n#Person2#: Unfortunately, sir, it's how the computer is programmed.\n#Person1#: This is outrageous! I'm never coming back to this hotel again!\n#Person2#: I'm sorry, sir. Perhaps you'd like to write a letter to headquarters.
#Person1#: Jack, I don't know how to write my resume. Could you tell me about that?\n#Person2#: You should first write your name and contact information.\n#Person1#: What does the contact information include?\n#Person2#: Such as your land line phone number, mobile phone number and e-mail box.\n#Person1#: Anything else?\n#Person2#: Then you should write your objectives, such as seeking a position in foreign trade.\n#Person1#: I see. It is the position desired\n#Person2#: Yes. After that you should emphasize your skills, educational background and related experience.\n#Person1#: I see. Skills are about specialty, and educational background is easy as well. But what about related experience? I have little work experience.\n#Person2#: Don't worry. It will take time to accumulate experience. You need to be confident for yourself.\n#Person1#: I see. By the way, should I write the educational background starting from elementary school?\n#Person2#: Generally from the college\n#Person1#: Thank you very much. I will write it right now.
#Person1#: I don't think Poppas is right for this position.\n#Person2#: I agree. He's got experience as a computer operator but he has very little training in programming. What about Anderson?\n#Person1#: I like him. He seems very enthusiastic and he knows a lot about programming.\n#Person2#: That's true. Do you think he is dependable enough, though? He's already had two different jobs this year. He might work for a couple of months and then decide to leave.\n#Person1#: I suppose so. But his last supervisor wrote a three-page letter of recommendation. He says Anderson is an excellent programmer.\n#Person2#: He probably is. But we don't want him to leave after we've spent a lot of time training him. Actually, I think Logan is the best candidate.\n#Person1#: She hasn't worked since she got married, hasn't she?\n#Person2#: She's been taking care of her family. But she is really devoted.\n#Person1#: Oh, yes. The letter from her principal says she did a wonderful job. Do you think she'll be a good programmer?\n#Person2#: I bet she will. She has an excellent letter of recommendation from her teacher at the institute she attended.\n#Person1#: That's true.\n#Person2#: And Logan seems more professional. She was well-dressed and seemed to have a very positive attitude about working for us.
#Person1#: Good morning, Plaza Hotel. Can I help you?\n#Person2#: Hello, I'm just checking the room rates. How much are the single rooms, please?\n#Person1#: Well, sir, the singles are now from 180 to 240 dollars.\n#Person2#: And the doubles?\n#Person1#: The double rooms are now 270 to 330 dollars.\n#Person2#: That includes tax, I suppose.\n#Person1#: No. But the price does include breakfast and service charge is extra.\n#Person2#: Thank you very much. I think I got that. That's singles from 180 to 240 dollars, doubles to 270 dollars.\n#Person1#: No. The price of doubles is from 270 to 330 dollars.\n#Person2#: Oh, I see. And can I get an extra bed if we need one?\n#Person1#: Yes, of course. An extra bed is 45 dollars.\n#Person2#: Okay, that's fine. Thank you very much.\n#Person1#: You're welcome.
#Person1#: Good afternoon. ABC Imports. May I help you?\n#Person2#: Yes, may I speak to Mr. James Johnson, please?\n#Person1#: I'm afraid Mr. Johnson isn't available right now. Would you like to leave a message?\n#Person2#: This is Richard Alexander with Star Electronics. It's very important that he returns my call this afternoon.\n#Person1#: Does he have your office number and your mobile phone number?\n#Person2#: I think so, but let me give them to you again.\n#Person1#: Okay.\n#Person2#: My office number is 714-555-2000; my cell phone number is 909-555-2308. He can reach me at my office number before 6 p.m. or anytime today on my mobile.\n#Person1#: Very well, I'll give him your message as soon as he returns to the office.
#Person1#: Hi, Tom. What are you reading?\n#Person2#: Oh, hi, Tanya. This is a newspaper, the Community News. It carries only good news.\n#Person1#: Oh, yeah. I think I've seen that.\n#Person2#: Yeah, isn't it a great idea? I'm so fed up with all the bad news you read about all the time. It's about time someone offers some creative choice to the mainstream newspapers.\n#Person1#: I don't know.., the problem with it is, if it's only good news, how do you know you're getting the whole story, and not just sugar-coated truth? It doesn't sound like objective journalism - that both sides of a story and all facts are being reported.
#Person1#: What's going on here?\n#Person2#: You mean, what's happening? Well, constable, I'm trying to get out of the window and Freud here is helping me.\n#Person1#: Why are you climbing through the window and not leaving by the front door?\n#Person2#: Well, you see I can't find the key and I'm in a hurry. Come on, Freud, we're wasting time.\n#Person1#: Just a minute you two. I don't think you're telling me the truth. This isn't your house, is it?\n#Person2#: No, it's my brother's. I'm staying with him for a while.\n#Person1#: Is he at home?\n#Person2#: I'm afraid not. He's just in jail for house-breaking at the moment.
#Person1#: Catherine, you look great in these photos.\n#Person2#: Oh, thanks. I got into that wedding dress with great difficulty. It was too small.\n#Person1#: Why didn't you get one your size?\n#Person2#: Oh, it was my grandmother's - my mother wore it on her wedding day, and I really wanted to wear it on mine. I suffered for six months so I could wear it.\n#Person1#: How did you do it?\n#Person2#: Do you know this diet that many actors are doing? I don't think it's very healthy if you do it for a long time, but it really works.\n#Person1#: I think meat is not allowed in your diet.\n#Person2#: No, actually, you can eat things like, um, roast chicken, steak, and bacon, but you can't eat any bread and butter.\n#Person1#: Is it the diet that you love but have to avoid?\n#Person2#: That's right. Dieting is so boring. Hopefully, I won't need to wear the wedding dress again anyway.
#Person1#: [Mr Baker is very happy to see Miss Green every morning because she is a good secretary. One Monday Miss Green didn't come to work because she was ill. She had a terrible cold and a bad headache, so she phoned Mr. Baker.] [The telephone rings.] Good morning, Mr. Baker.\n#Person2#: Good morning, Miss Green. What's wrong? Where are you?\n#Person1#: I am at home. I'm ill. I'm afraid I've got a terrible cold and a bad headache.\n#Person2#: I'm very sorry to hear that. Well, you'd better stay at home.\n#Person1#: Thank you, Mr. Baker. See you tomorrow.\n#Person2#: See you tomorrow. Goodbye.\n#Person1#: Goodbye, Mr. Baker.
#Person1#: What are you reading, Bill?\n#Person2#: It's this week's New Scientist. Why?\n#Person1#: I was just wondering. It looks interesting, but I've never actually read it myself. It's for real scientists, or can ordinary people like me understand it?\n#Person2#: Oh, it's for anyone really. It usually has articles and stories about current affairs about science, as well as papers about new developments in research, I'm reading about a new telephone that allows you to see the person you are speaking to, as well as hear him.\n#Person1#: Oh, I've heard about it. Is it on the market yet? Can I buy one?\n#Person2#: No, not this one. But the company has made other models to try out on business. This one is special because of its color, and the images moving.\n#Person1#: Oh, that's interesting.\n#Person2#: You see, the first videophones--that's what they are called--were made in Japan. But they can only show a still black-and-white image, so this videophone is much better than that. Mind you, I'm not sure I'd want one, would you?\n#Person1#: Well, no. I don't think I would. I bet it costs a lot of money. Does it say how much it costs?\n#Person2#: Yes. The early black-and-white ones cost several hundred pounds. But the one is about costs several thousand pounds.\n#Person1#: Hum. Why does anybody want one, do you think?\n#Person2#: Business organizations that need to frequently contact overseas organizations would want it. It's like a face-to-face conversation. So maybe a lot of overseas travel can be avoided.\n#Person1#: Yes, I suppose so.
#Person1#: Can you tell us what you like doing in the evening?\n#Person2#: Well, I like music. I listen to a lot of pop music. But most of all, I like watching TV. It's much better than reading a book.
#Person1#: He's here. Bye Dad.\n#Person2#: Wait, wait, wait ... Where are you going?\n#Person1#: Dad. I've already told mom. I'm going out tonight.\n#Person2#: Who with? You mean you're going on a date?\n#Person1#: Yeah. Mom met Dirk yesterday. [Dirk!?] He's sooo cool. We're going on a double-date with Cindy and Evan.\n#Person2#: Dirk.\n#Person1#: I have to go.\n#Person2#: Wait, wait. I want to meet this guy.\n#Person1#: He's waiting for me.\n#Person2#: Well, so what are you going to do tonight? Going to the library?\n#Person1#: Dad! We're going out to eat, and then we're going to catch a movie.\n#Person2#: What movie and what is it rated?\n#Person1#: It's a science fiction thriller called ... well, I don't know what it is called, but it's rated PG.\n#Person2#: And where's the movie showing?\n#Person1#: Down at the Campus Plaza Movie Theater.\n#Person2#: Hey, I was thinking about seeing a movie down there tonight, too.\n#Person1#: Ah, Dad.\n#Person2#: Hey, Let me meet that guy. [Father looks out the living room window] ... Hey, that guy has a moustache!\n#Person1#: Dad. That's not Dirk. That's his older brother. He's taking us there! Can I go now?\n#Person2#: Well ...\n#Person1#: Mom said I could, and mom knows his parents.\n#Person2#: Well ...\n#Person1#: Dad.\n#Person2#: Okay, but be home by 8:00.\n#Person1#: Eight!? The movie doesn't start until 7:30. Come on, Dad.\n#Person2#: Okay. Be back by 11:00.\n#Person1#: Love you, Dad.\n#Person2#: Love you, too.\n#Person1#: Bye.\n#Person2#: Bye.
#Person1#: . . . Now that we have been over the gory details of our disastrous first quarter, Ed! Give us some good news. How are things looking for us in termsof sales this month? \n#Person2#: Uh well. . . would you like the bad news first or the really bad news? \n#Person1#: What? Ed, don't tell me you only have bad news! \n#Person2#: Well sir, our sales have dropped, no plunged, fifty percent in the past month alone. We are currently overstocked and overstaffed and our profits arefalling fast. The market is in recession and we have no way of moving our inventory, or getting rid of our staff. If we consider redundancies, it would cost us a fortune because of the new regulations governing compensation packages. It's a real mess. \n#Person1#: For crying out loud. . . How fast are we losing money? \n#Person2#: Um. . . how can I put this? Let's just say that at this pace, we will be filing for Chapter eleven in less than three months. \n#Person1#: What! Geez! How could this have happened? So what's the bad news? \n#Person2#: Oh, that's the really bad news. Our supplier suffered QC problems and, well, half of our production is faulty. We're going to have to recall all itemssold in the last quarter. And the worst part? We're going to have to shoulder this cost. \n#Person1#: Are you joking? Get the supplier on the line now! They have to assume the costs of this mess! \n#Person2#: We tried that, sir. The factory has gone under and the owner apparently has fled the country. \n#Person1#: We're doomed! \n#Person2#: There is some really good news though! \n#Person1#: Really? What! \n#Person2#: I got offered a new job! 
#Person1#: Did you watch TV last night, Rose? \n#Person2#: Yeah. I saw a science program. It was quite interesting. \n#Person1#: What was it about? \n#Person2#: Mars. Scientists say there might be water on it. \n#Person1#: If so, we may live there someday. \n#Person2#: I hope so. Did you know the US successfully sent two robotic explorers to Mars last month? \n#Person1#: Sure. I heard about this on the TV. On January 3rd , 2004, Explorer Spirit landed near the so-called Gusev Crater. And three weeks later, Spirit's twin explorer, Opportunity, landed on Meridiani Planum named by scientists. \n#Person2#: Yes. Both have sent back pictures of the planet. And the latter did a better job. 
#Person1#: How smart of you to book the tickets before hand! \n#Person2#: Oh, do you really think so? \n#Person1#: Of course, otherwise you'll just have to wait for hours. \n#Person2#: But I just got a call from my sister and I have to cancel the movie tonight. 
#Person1#: I heard that James was fired because he got a keep back of 20 thousands dollars from a vender. \n#Person2#: That's open secret. \n#Person1#: But mine could be a lie for his job. \n#Person2#: How did you know that? \n#Person1#: A little bird whispered to me. Keep that to yourself. 
#Person1#: I really admire you, Diana. \n#Person2#: why, Jerry? Your words just came out of the blue. \n#Person1#: you are really happy and able to achieve high scores at school. \n#Person2#: I work very hard and that's it, you know, practice makes perfect. \n#Person1#: isn't there anything else? \n#Person2#: I have no idea. \n#Person1#: you must have a high IQ score. \n#Person2#: well, Jerry, let me tell you a secret. \n#Person1#: go ahead. \n#Person2#: my IQ score is slightly above average. \n#Person1#: seriously? But you are such a genius. \n#Person2#: maybe I've got a higher EQ. I'm not sure. \n#Person1#: well, perhaps you're right. Sometimes EQ matters more than IQ. \n#Person2#: you can say that again, Jerry. And I'm sure you're high in both of them. With a little more time cracking the books, you can also get high marks. \n#Person1#: oh, thank you. I'm going to the library, are you coming? \n#Person2#: let's go! 
#Person1#: You know, I don't quite understand the Chinese criterion of beauty. I mean, I asked some Chinese guys who had seen my girlfriend. I asked them, Isn't she beautiful? They were looking at me with eyes wide open, like ... and they even wondered how in the world I could ever have fallen in love with her! \n#Person2#: I understand. I've heard quite a few people say that most Chinese women that foreigners have chosen are not pretty at all. I know I'm one of those that they were describing. I'm surely not beautiful. \n#Person3#: Oh, come on, although you married a foreigner, you're not that bad! \n#Person1#: I mean I think my girlfriend is very pretty and cute. She has these red cheeks, and her silk hair has been evenly cut. Very pretty, very charming. \n#Person3#: Chinese don't notice that sort of thing at all. Amy, what is that saying? \n#Person2#: Beauty is in the eyes of the beholder. \n#Person3#: Yeah, that's right. Magic love. 
#Person1#: Good afternoon. Can I help you? \n#Person2#: Yes, we have a reservation for three nights. Mona White. I called last week. \n#Person1#: One moment please, Ms. White. Yes, that was for two single rooms, wasn't it? I've reserved rooms 402 and 403 for you. \n#Person2#: Are they quiet rooms? \n#Person1#: Well they are facing the street but there's a lovely view. \n#Person2#: We'd like quiet rooms thanks. \n#Person1#: Of course 
#Person1#: Good morning. I'm from the New York book review. Could I ask you some questions about your latest book? \n#Person2#: Sure. Take a seat... what would you like to know? \n#Person1#: First, I've heard that your latest book is based on a true story. \n#Person2#: That's correct. It's a murder mystery based on actual murders that book place in Florida several years ago. The main character-the police invesigator-is based on the man who investigated the case. \n#Person1#: How do you research your books? \n#Person2#: I always visit the places that I use as setting for stories. Readers like things to be as factually correct as possible-even in fiction! I usually base my characters on people I have met. Most character are a mixture of the characters of two or more people. \n#Person1#: I really like your books. I've just finished this one. I read it from cover to cover in a single day. Congratulation on making the bestseller list yet again! \n#Person2#: Thank you. Let met sign it for you ... there you go. \n#Person1#: Oh! Thank you very much. I heard that you are currently writing a collection of short stories. What are the stories about? \n#Person2#: There's a real mix of stories in the book. I haven't finished all of them yet, though. Many of them are short detective stories, but there are also horror stories and sci-fi ones. If you give me your business card, I'll make sure you get an advance copy to review. \n#Person1#: Thanks very much. I'm sure it will sell well. I can't wait to read it. Here's my card. Thank you for you time. 
#Person1#: Robert, you play the guitar, don't you?\n#Person2#: I used to. But I haven't played it for quite some time. I don't really have time these days with all my studies. Why do you ask?\n#Person1#: I'm trying to organize a group to play at some parties on weekends. We still need a guitar player.\n#Person2#: Well, I don't know. But your idea sounds fun to me.\n#Person1#: Oh, it will be. I'm more or less in charge of things. So if you want to give it a try, you're in. It's as easy as that. Besides, it's a great chance to get out and meet people.\n#Person2#: But I told you I haven't practiced for a long time. I don't know if I remember any songs I used to play.\n#Person1#: Don't worry about it. I just thought I'd ask you to try and join us sometime when we were practicing. We'll be practicing for a few months before we give performances.\n#Person2#: OK, I'll have a try.\n#Person1#: I'm sure you can do it. And it will be fun, too.
#Person1#: Could I have a word with you, sir?\n#Person2#: Just speaking.\n#Person1#: I have to tell you that I can't be in today and tomorrow.\n#Person2#: So sorry to hear that. What's wrong with you?\n#Person1#: I feel sick and coughed a lot at night.\n#Person2#: Is that serious? You ought to see a doctor.\n#Person1#: Yes, I did this in the morning. And my doctor wanted me to have a rest these 2 days.\n#Person2#: That's good. Do you suppose you will be back to the company the day after tomorrow?\n#Person1#: I hope so. And I will definitely tell you if I cannot.\n#Person2#: Well, take care of yourself and I hope you will be better as soon as possible.
#Person1#: I have noticed that a lot of people around here are very healthy and hard working. I thought all Americans just ate hamburgers and pizza and sat in front of the TV all day long.\n#Person2#: Huh... well, our culture and society has become a lot more health conscious than it was 10 years ago.\n#Person1#: I have heard a lot of people talking about organic foods and even growing their own vegetables.\n#Person2#: Yes, things are different now. I think most people are just more aware than before whether it is about themselves or the world. There is so much information out there. People are less ignorant than they were before.\n#Person1#: More attention has been drawn toward protecting the environment.\n#Person2#: I agree, but there are also many problems that we still need to overcome. Let's not get into that.\n#Person1#: Focus on the positive, right? So what do you do to play your part in a healthy society?\n#Person2#: I try to avoid driving my car as much as possible.\n#Person1#: Good for you. I wish more people had the same attitude as you.
#Person1#: Can I help you?\n#Person2#: Yes please. I'm looking for a smartphone, but uhm? I don't know much about them.\n#Person1#: Right. Well, with a smart phone you can use software, you know for your appointments, as an address book, that kind of thing you can take notes and write documents.\n#Person2#: I see I'm interested in this one.\n#Person1#: This one? It's got all the features you'd expect. A nice screen, wireless internet.\n#Person2#: So I can check my email, can I?\n#Person1#: Yeah you can read and send email and surf the Internet, too. As long as you're in an area the Internet can cover.\n#Person2#: It's got a camera hasn't it?\n#Person1#: Yeah, it's really good. You can take photos or videos. You can download video games and it's got an MP3 player for your favorite songs. You can even watch TV.\n#Person2#: Wow. I really like the functions they're wonderful.
#Person1#: What seems to be the matter?\n#Person2#: I just can't sleep well, doctor.\n#Person1#: I see and how long have you had this problem?\n#Person2#: Oh, for about 2 weeks now.\n#Person1#: 2 weeks? Do you have headaches?\n#Person2#: sometimes.\n#Person1#: Fever?\n#Person2#: No.\n#Person1#: Are you having any family problems?\n#Person2#: No, not really, we all get along pretty well.\n#Person1#: And how about work?\n#Person2#: Well I've been working a lot lately. More than 11 hours a day.\n#Person1#: Maybe you should take a vacation and just rest for a few days.\n#Person2#: Well, I can't right now, we're in the middle of some important business.\n#Person1#: Yes, I understand, but you really need to slow down. You're going to kill yourself if you go on like this.
#Person1#: Hi, Adam, what are you doing?\n#Person2#: I've just got home from my tennis lesson. Have you had dinner yet?\n#Person1#: No, not yet.\n#Person2#: I'm hungry. Do you want me to help you cook?\n#Person1#: No, I've already done it. I prepared the fish this morning and cooked it earlier this evening.\n#Person2#: Great. Let's eat. I'll put the knives and forks on the table.\n#Person1#: I've just done that a minute ago, but I haven't put any glasses on the table yet. Can you do that please?\n#Person2#: OK.
#Person1#: Hello, can I help?\n#Person2#: I'm from Lexington Software and I'm here to collect an export L / C.\n#Person1#: I have it right here.\n#Person2#: Great. Can I take it with me now? Or do you need me to fill in some forms or something?\n#Person1#: No, you can take it away now. I just need you to sign here.\n#Person2#: Here you are.\n#Person1#: Just one thing before you go, could you please prepare your documents in accordance with the L / C within the validity period?\n#Person2#: No problem, I'll get on that right away. Thanks, bye.
#Person1#: Good afternoon, how may I help you?\n#Person2#: Hi, I'd like to order some flowers.\n#Person1#: Who are they for?\n#Person2#: They're for my Wife. Her name is Samantha.\n#Person1#: What kind of flowers would you like?\n#Person2#: I don't know. I don't know too much about flowers. Can you recommend something?\n#Person1#: OK. What's the reason you are sending her flowers?\n#Person2#: Today's her birthday and she told me she wants me to buy her flowers.\n#Person1#: Do you know what kind of flowers she likes?\n#Person2#: I'm not sure. I know I should know that, but I can't remember right now.\n#Person1#: Well, they're for your wife, so I think you should give her roses.\n#Person2#: Roses will be fine.\n#Person1#: What color?\n#Person2#: I think red would be nice.\n#Person1#: Do you want to pick them up or should we deliver them?\n#Person2#: Can you deliver them, please?\n#Person1#: What's the address?\n#Person2#: 241 Main street.
#Person1#: did you know that abortion is still illegal in many states in the USA?\n#Person2#: why? I thought Americans were supposed to be more open than that.\n#Person1#: well, for many religious people, they believe that people who abort their babies are murderers.\n#Person2#: do you think most people in America believe that abortion is wrong?\n#Person1#: no, I think it's mostly the older generation who are against abortions.\n#Person2#: it's no wonder there are so many teenage pregnancies in America.\n#Person1#: religious people blame it on pre-marital sex, not on abortion being illegal.\n#Person2#: what do you think about abortion?\n#Person1#: I personally would never want to have one, but I think that since a pregnancy can affect a woman's entire life, she should have the right to decide for herself.\n#Person2#: do you think the fathers should have some kind of say in the matter?\n#Person1#: I know this is going to sound sexist, but I don't think that men should have to give their approval to the mothers of their children.\n#Person2#: why not? It's their children, too.\n#Person1#: that may be true, but when a woman gets pregnant, it changes her life completely. Men can still carry on with their lives after the birth exactly as they did beforehand.\n#Person2#: that might be true, but I think men should have some kind of say in the matter.
#Person1#: Excuse me, is this seat taken?\n#Person2#: I ' m afraid this seat is taken.\n#Person1#: Oh. is it. Thank you anyway.\n#Person2#: You ' re welcome. Why don ' t you ask the conductor when he comes by?\n#Person1#: Thank you.

I was impressed with how smart he was and he has a great sense of humor.\n#Person1#: oh, it's love at first sight. When will you see each other again?\n#Person2#: he didn't say, but he said he would call me.\n#Person1#: maybe he is busy with his work. Just wait and try not to think about it too much!\n#Person2#: oh, steve. Stop it! I am a bit nervous! What if he doesn't call?\n#Person1#: come on, Mary, you're a total catch. I bet he will call you. Don't worry.\n#Person2#: thank you, Steve. You're always so encouraging.\n#Person1#: that's what friends are for.
#Person1#: Would you give me some fruits? How much are these oranges?\n#Person2#: Seventy cents a piece.\n#Person1#: How about this one?\n#Person2#: Sixty cents a piece.\n#Person1#: Well, I'll take five of the seventy cents ones, and are those grapefruits sweet?\n#Person2#: Sure! They are very fresh, first of all. We sell at a bargain, and you make a wise purchase if you buy them today. Eighty cents only, a piece.\n#Person1#: I follow you and I'll take three just for my trial.\n#Person2#: Thank you very much and anything else?\n#Person1#: That's all. Thank you.

Your birthday is on Christmas Day.\n#Person1#: Yes, I am lucky. I was born on Christ's birthday. Maybe that is why I usually go to church on Sundays. When is your birthday?\n#Person2#: April 2nd. I missed being a target of a lot of jokes by one day. I guess I am lucky, too!\n#Person1#: That is true! Here, have some Granola for breakfast.\n#Person2#: Thanks.\n#Person1#: After eating, we will take down our tent. Then we will pack everything into the canoe, We can shove off by 6\n#Person2#: I guess so.\n#Person1#: How about going for swim around 10\n#Person2#: That should work out great. You are miracle worker! You have got me awake and motivated.\n#Person1#: Happy Independence Day!

Do you like it?\n#Person2#: i like my professors and the classes, but it's a lot of work.\n#Person1#: what are you specializing in?\n#Person2#: right now, I'm doing some research into the languages of different African tribes.\n#Person1#: that sounds really interesting.

Did you study hard?\n#Person2#: You know me ; I'm always studying!\n#Person1#: don't worry. If you don't do well, no one can!\n#Person2#: Thanks for the vote of confidence, Justin!
#Person1#: Say, Anna, what are you doing tonight? Would you like to go out?\n#Person2#: Oh, sorry, I can't. I'm going to work late tonight. I have to finish this report.\n#Person1#: Well, how about tomorrow night? Are you doing anything then?\n#Person2#: No, I'm not. What are you planning to do?\n#Person1#: I'm going to see a musical.

#Person1#: I was wondering if I could borrow the company van for a fundraiser this weekend.\n#Person2#: Sure, I think that would be possible. Where is the fundraiser?\n#Person1#: It is in the park downtown.\n#Person2#: Would you need it for both Saturday and Sunday?\n#Person1#: We will need it for Saturday only.\n#Person2#: I think that would be OK.

Oh, you seem to be correct.\n#Person1#: How about tax and service charge?\n#Person2#: Only ten percent tax is included in the bill.\n#Person1#: Then one hundred U. S. dollars covers everything, doesn't it?\n#Person2#: It sure does.
#Person1#: Why did your parents make you stay at home?\n#Person2#: They wanted to go out, and so they made me look after my baby brother.\n#Person1#: Didn't you mind doing it?\n#Person2#: No, I didn't. My brother was very good and I did quite a lot of homework.\n#Person1#: Didn't you even want to go to the cinema?\n#Person2#: Not really. I watched television for an hour.\n#Person1#: What was on television last night?\n#Person2#: Boxing. It was excellent.\n#Person1#: Oh. I enjoy watching boxing on television, too. What a pity I missed it last night!\n#Person2#: What did you do last night?\n#Person1#: I went to a boxing match in the sports stadium.
#Person1#: I'm sure that the boy will become nobody when he grows up.\n#Person2#: Be careful of what you say, or you'll have to eat humble pie.\n#Person1#: Eat humble pie? Impossible, I'Ve never been wrong in judging boys like him.
#Person1#: What are you going to have for breakfast?\n#Person2#: I just have some cereal each morning.\n#Person1#: You're supposed to always have a hearty breakfast.\n#Person2#: I don't always have time to make breakfast.\n#Person1#: It's easy to make a quick breakfast.\n#Person2#: What do you have for breakfast?\n#Person1#: When I need to make a quick breakfast, I just make some oatmeal, toast, and OJ.\n#Person2#: That's a good idea.\n#Person1#: It's not time consuming at all.\n#Person2#: It doesn't take much time to make?\n#Person1#: Would you like me to make something?\n#Person2#: Why don't you make me some oatmeal and toast?
#Person1#: Hi, Steven, take a seat! How are things at work?\n#Person2#: It's coming along well, but it is a little delayed.\n#Person1#: Can you finish it on time?\n#Person2#: I'm pressed for time and I am afraid I need someone to help me.\n#Person1#: OK, I will send Beker to help you. We need to get the brochures done and sent them to our clients on Friday without delay.\n#Person2#: OK, we promise to do it well.
#Person1#: Good afternoon, Chloe, I'm Doctor Evans. What seems to be the problem?\n#Person2#: Hi, Dr. Evans. Thanks for seeing me on such short notice. When I woke up this morning I had a really sore throat and a really bad cough. I think I am coming down with the flu.\n#Person1#: Ah I see, yes you do sound rather croaky. Well let's have a look, shall we? Could you please open your mouth and say ' ah '.\n#Person2#: Ahhhhhhhh\n#Person1#: Good, yes, your tonsils are a little swollen and red. How are your ears, blocked at all?\n#Person2#: A little actually. My sinuses are a little blocked up as well-I really feel terrible.\n#Person1#: Ok Chloe, can you please breathe in and out slowly for me while I listen to your chest? You really are all bunged up, you don't sound too good at all. Ok, I'm going to set you up with a bunch of antibiotics. You will need to take these orange pills twice a day and these blue pills every evening. You will also have to take this cough medicine three times a day after meals. Finally, I am giving you an inhaler to use every time you feel breathless. . . just to clear up your lungs!\n#Person2#: Whoa! So many drugs. . . I hate swallowing pills. Am I able to go to work?\n#Person1#: Absolutely not! You are highly contagious! You don't want to infect the rest of your co-workers do you? I recommend staying in bed for at least three days and drinking plenty of fluids so you don't get weak and dehydrated. You can catch up on all the latest TV shows and movies!\n#Person2#: Ok! Would you mind writing me a doctor's note for work, otherwise they may think I am faking it!\n#Person1#: Ha-ha, sure not a problem! Here you are. Now off you go and away to bed. If you have any questions just give me a call! Feel better soon and take care.\n#Person2#: Thanks doc, bye!
#Person1#: Mom, look! My first piggy bank and it still has money in it!\n#Person2#: That is a blast from the past.\n#Person1#: Remember when I used to beg you to break it so I could go buy ice cream?\n#Person2#: Yes. You sure have come a long way in valuing your hard earned dollars.\n#Person1#: Thanks for not giving in to my childhood tantrums, mom.\n#Person2#: But what are you going to do with that pig?\n#Person1#: I think I'm going to keep it as a monument to what I've learned about money.\n#Person2#: Who knows, maybe one day he will sit on the desk of a top CEO in a major corporation!
#Person1#: I'll show you around and explain the operation as we go along.\n#Person2#: That'll be most helpful.\n#Person1#: That is our office block. We have all the administrative departments there. Down there is the research and development section.\n#Person2#: How much do you spend on development every year?\n#Person1#: About 3-4 % of the gross sales.\n#Person2#: What's that building opposite us?\n#Person1#: That's the warehouse. We keep a stock of the faster moving items so that urgent orders can be met quickly from stock.\n#Person2#: If I placed an order now, how long would it be before I got delivery?\n#Person1#: It would largely depend on the size of the order and the items you want.
#Person1#: So, where is this bus supposed to take us?\n#Person2#: It should take us back up to Altadena.\n#Person1#: Well, don't you know for sure?\n#Person2#: I'm not really sure if it does or not.\n#Person1#: Are you sure we got on the right bus?\n#Person2#: I've never taken this bus, but I think it's the right one.\n#Person1#: This place doesn't look like Altadena.\n#Person2#: That's true, and we have been on this bus for a while.\n#Person1#: Read one of the street signs or something.\n#Person2#: Yikes! Temple City.\n#Person1#: That's the last time I'm trusting you with the transportation.\n#Person2#: My bad, but at least we know the right bus to take us back.
#Person1#: Johnny, I want to thank you.\n#Person2#: What do you mean, Mom? For breaking your best china?\n#Person1#: Oh, Johnny, that stuff was dollar store junk. No, I want to thank you for keeping Grandma busy.\n#Person2#: Well, it's more like she kept me busy. . .\n#Person1#: I know, and normally she's trying to tell me how to clean my house. So, thank you.\n#Person2#: Am I back in your good books?\n#Person1#: Not only that, but I'm going to buy you that video game after all!
#Person1#: Hi Michael.\n#Person2#: Hi Amy. What's up?\n#Person1#: I'm looking for the airport. Can you tell me how to get there?\n#Person2#: No, sorry. I don't know.\n#Person1#: I think I can take the subway to the airport. Do you know where the subway is?\n#Person2#: Sure, it's over there.\n#Person1#: Where? I don't see it.\n#Person2#: Across the street.\n#Person1#: Oh, I see it now. Thanks.\n#Person2#: No problem.\n#Person1#: Do you know if there's a restroom around here?\n#Person2#: Yes, there's one here. It's in the store.\n#Person1#: Thank you.\n#Person2#: Bye.
#Person1#: Can I help you, madam?\n#Person2#: Yes, I'm looking for a cap. Size 16.\n#Person1#: Would you like to try this one on?\n#Person2#: Yes. It's a bit tight. Have you got a bigger one?\n#Person1#: All right. How about this one?\n#Person2#: Yes, that's fine. I'll take it. Can I pay by check?\n#Person1#: Of course, madam.
#Person1#: When can we expect you and your daughter for dinner? Next Saturday?\n#Person2#: Next Saturday? I'm sorry. I'Ve promised to go to a Chinese Opera with my daughter.\n#Person1#: How about Sunday then?\n#Person2#: Yes, Sunday sounds fine. What time?\n#Person1#: Does 6, 30 suit you?\n#Person2#: It suits us fine. We'll see you then.\n#Person1#: Thanks, goodbye.
#Person1#: Hi. You said that you might need some help with preparing dinner. What would you like me to do?\n#Person2#: Thanks for coming over to help. I really appreciate it. First, could you peel the vegetables? I'Ve put them all in the skin and there's a peeler.\n#Person1#: Ok, I'll peel the vegetables and you chop them. I'm terrible at chopping vegetables. I always seem to chop them into pieces that are either too big or too small. . . . wow! You can chop vegetable really quickly, just like professional chefs on TV!\n#Person2#: After you'Ve chopped the vegetables, could you fry the meat in a little oil? Just use a very small amount of oil. Fry the meat until it is cooked, then we'll add some spices to flavor it.\n#Person1#: Which spices are you going to add to the meat?\n#Person2#: These ones here. The one on the left is very spicy, so we must be careful about how much we add.\n#Person1#: Yes. We don't want everyone to burn their mouths and have a drink gallons of water! OK. I'm really to do the meat. Should I cook it over a low flame?\n#Person2#: Cook it over a high flame, so that it will be ready quickly. Keep stirring the meat around the frying pan. Don't let the meat stick to the bottom of the pan.\n#Person1#: Right. What are you doing over there?\n#Person2#: I'm mixing the sauce. It's my specialty. I make it according to my own secret recipe!
#Person1#: Hello, Madam. What can I do for you today?\n#Person2#: Hello. I'd like to send 600 RMB in cash to my daughter. How long will it take for her to receive the money?\n#Person1#: It's very quick and easy. It just takes 24 hours, we guarantee that. All you need to do is fill in this slip and we can proceed.\n#Person2#: Are there any extra charges, like commission?\n#Person1#: There is a service commission that you must pay. It's 1 % of the funds to be remitted, so you should pay an extra 6 RIB.
#Person1#: You see, I'm getting much fatter than before. I'm always worried I've no idea how to lose weight.\n#Person2#: You should do some exercise every day. That is the best way to keep you healthy and strong.\n#Person1#: You know, I don't want to move about at all.\n#Person2#: You'd better not watch too much TV. Recently, dancing machines have been popular in China. I suggest buying one.\n#Person1#: What is the dancing machine?\n#Person2#: Oh, you may see one in shopping centres. It's easy to learn how to use it. What you ought to do is to dance on such machines with loud disco music, stepping forward and backward, left and right according to the directions on TV, as if you are really dancing.\n#Person1#: That sounds interesting! But is it useful to help me keep fit?\n#Person2#: Sure. When you finish dancing, you'll be out of breath.\n#Person1#: Where can I find one?\n#Person2#: You may go to the Friendship Store.\n#Person1#: Is it expensive?\n#Person2#: I don't think so. It only costs 800 yuan.\n#Person1#: All right. I'd like to buy one.
#Person1#: What do you think you'll be doing in five years' time, Carrie?\n#Person2#: I definitely won't be working as a car park attendant. I want to become an opera singer. I hope I'll be living in Milan. What about you, Frank?\n#Person1#: Unless I pass my exams, I'll probably serve rude customers in the restaurant.\n#Person2#: Come on. Don't be so sad. Cheer up, Frank.
#Person1#: Excuse me, would you please tell me when the next flight to Los Angeles is?\n#Person2#: Sure. The next direct flight to Los Angeles is two hours from now, but if you do not mind transferring at San Francisco you can board now.
#Person1#: It's freezing cold. Let me make some coffee to warm us up. Do you want a piece of pie as well?\n#Person2#: Coffee sounds great. But I'm going to have dinner with some friends in a while, so I'd better skip the pie.
#Person1#: Are you all right, Mark? Is anything wrong?\n#Person2#: I'm so homesick, I could die. All this studying, all this pressure, I just can't stand it.\n#Person1#: It takes time to get used to all this.\n#Person2#: Yes. But, you know, I lost sleep last night.\n#Person1#: It seems like you've really got the blues. Have you heard from home recently?\n#Person2#: It's been almost a month since I got a letter from my mum. I'm going to write to her and explain the situation. By the way, do you have an envelope that I can borrow?\n#Person1#: Sorry, I don't have any. I hardly ever send any letters.\n#Person2#: The bookstore is closed today. Is there another place I can get some stamps?\n#Person1#: You can go to the post office on North Street to buy stamps.
#Person1#: Do you have somewhere to stay in London, Peter?\n#Person2#: No, I don't. In fact, I was about to ask you if you could arrange some place for me to stay.\n#Person1#: Yes, that's no problem though I am not in charge of it. I'll ask someone to arrange it for you. What kind of place were you considering?\n#Person2#: Well, I don't care if I share with other people, but I'm not good at housework. Maybe a home stay would be OK, but I don't like young children, because they're noisy and it's difficult to study. Hopefully, I can live with a lady who has retired.\n#Person1#: OK, that's no problem. But I must warn you that living with a family in London is very expensive. Much more expensive than other small cities.\n#Person2#: That's not a big problem. I have some money saved. Besides, I can always get a part-time job. I'm working in a supermarket as a cashier now. So I don't think I will have trouble with money.\n#Person1#: Sounds good. I'll call you if I get some information about that.\n#Person2#: OK, that's great. Thank you very much.\n#Person1#: You are welcome.
#Person1#: Stay with me, kids. Don't get lost. \n#Person2#: I am not Dad. I never get lost in the supermarket. \n#Person3#: I am not a kid anymore, Mom. \n#Person1#: Anyway, stay with me. I want to check out some daily necessities. \n#Person3#: No, Mom. I want to go to the video products section. The new album of Westlife just comes out. \n#Person2#: I want to buy some sports supplies. \n#Person1#: OK, kids. You can go. We'll meet by lunch time. \n#Person3#: How about Dad? He is outside with our stuff. \n#Person2#: We can call him then. \n#Person1#: All right, kids. Remember, 12 o'clock, at the 2nd cash counter. \n#Person3#: Who is that? \n#Person1#: It's Dad. He got a free deposit box. \n#Person3#: Finally, he is released. \n#Person1#: He called to tell us that he was in the book section. 
#Person1#: Have you decided what you are going to take next semester? \n#Person2#: Well, I'm an English major, you know. So I came here to make sure I'm taking the right things. \n#Person1#: Good. I think it's a good idea. Our department should require meetings like this. \n#Person2#: I want to finish my degree in four years. So I don't want to forget to take classes I need. I have a friend who has to stay in college another year. She didn't know until recently . There were some classes she needed to take to graduate. She didn't know about them. \n#Person1#: Yes, that happens. \n#Person2#: I brought my transcript from my first year. Here. And here is the list of courses I plan to take in the fall. \n#Person1#: Alright. Good. I see you've already taken six credits of your breadth requirements. You have one botany class and one chemistry class. And political science. So that's nine credits. Did you take English Composition 201? \n#Person2#: No, I don't need to. I took Advanced Placement English in high school. So I'm not required to take composition. \n#Person1#: Excellent. I see you have the 18th century poetry class for next semester. And the modern novel class. You haven't taken a Shakespeare class yet. \n#Person2#: No, I thought I would take it later. \n#Person1#: Actually, I recommend you take Shakespeare sooner rather than later. \n#Person2#: Well, I suppose I could cross out the 18th century poetry class. I have to see when the Shakespeare class meets. \n#Person1#: Let me look at the timetable. Shakespeare meets Monday, Wednesday and Friday at 11 \n#Person2#: I can take it then. I have that time slot free. \n#Person1#: Good. I recommend it. Shakespeare is of course enormously important. We want our students to take the class as soon as they can. And Professor Friedman is an excellent teacher. \n#Person2#: I'll take it then. \n#Person1#: Tell me, Lisa, what made you decide to be an English major? \n#Person2#: I want to be an English professor in the future. I love studying literature, and I want to teach it. \n#Person1#: Really? That's great to know. \n#Person2#: That's the reason I want to finish my B. A. in four years. Because I know I will be in school a long time. I want to start the M. A. and Ph. D. program as soon as possible. 
#Person1#: Hello, Anna speaking! \n#Person2#: Hey, Anna, this is Jason. \n#Person1#: Jason, where have you been hiding lately? You know it's been a long time since your last call. Have you been good? \n#Person2#: Yes. How are you, Anna? \n#Person1#: I am fine. What have you been doing? \n#Person2#: Working. I've been really busy these days. I got a promotion. \n#Person1#: That's great, congratulations! \n#Person2#: Thanks. I am feeling pretty good about myself too. You know, bigger office, a raise and even an assistant. \n#Person1#: That's good. So I guess I'll have to make an appointment to see you. \n#Person2#: You are kidding. \n#Person1#: How long have you been working there? \n#Person2#: A bit over two years. This is a fast-moving company, and seniority isn't the only factor in deciding promotions. \n#Person1#: How do you like your new boss? \n#Person2#: She is very nice and open-minded. \n#Person1#: Much better than the last one, huh? \n#Person2#: Yeah. He was a real slave driver. He probably would have loved it if we were robots. \n#Person1#: Forget about him. Come over to my house tonight. Let's get drunk. \n#Person2#: Good. Tonight 8 o'clock. \n#Person1#: 8 it is. See you then. \n#Person2#: Bye. 
#Person1#: Did you hear what's going on downtown today? All the workers from the factory are staging a demonstration in the streets. Not one of the two thousand employees showed up for work today, and they have gathered outside the city hall to demand better working conditions for all factory employees.\n#Person2#: Wow, sounds chaotic. . . . two thousand people in the streets carrying picket signs and shouting slogans. What gave them the motivation to finally organize and call management on the substandard working conditions? \n#Person1#: I think they gained courage after the mayor's speech last week on equality and opportunity for all town citizens. Anyway, the sentiments have been brewing for quite some time. I mean, we all know the working conditions at the factory are quite horrendous. \n#Person2#: So what kind of demands do they have? What are they asking for specifically? \n#Person1#: They want raises and medical insurance, and I think they want to clean up the factory's safety hazards. That's probably the most important issue. 
#Person1#: Come back. You haven't paid yet. \n#Person2#: May, just let him go. \n#Person1#: But he took some newspaper away without paying. \n#Person2#: I know. \n#Person1#: Why? You make me confused. \n#Person2#: He lives nearby and he would just glance at the newspaper headlines, read the political sections and return them later. \n#Person1#: Why does he have such a privilege? \n#Person2#: He used to be a hero during the war time and everyone respect him. \n#Person1#: I see. Does he live by himself? \n#Person2#: Yes, he has no children and his wife passed away when he was in the battle. \n#Person1#: He must be lonely? \n#Person2#: I bet. But he is always busy telling the children stories. \n#Person1#: How respectable! 
#Person1#: I have made up my mind. I am getting a tattoo. \n#Person2#: Really? Are you sure? \n#Person1#: Yeah! Why not? They are trendy and look great! I want to get a dragon on my arm or maybe a tiger on my back. \n#Person2#: Yeah but, it is something that you will have forever! They use indelible ink that can only be removed with laser treatment. On top of all that, I have heard it hurts a lot! \n#Person1#: Really? \n#Person2#: Of course! They use this machine with a needle that pokes your skin and inserts the ink. \n#Person1#: Oh, I didn't know that! I thought they just paint it on your skin or something. \n#Person2#: I think you should reconsider and do some more research about tattoos. Also, find out where the nearest tattoo parlor is and make sure they used sterilized needles, and that the place is hygienic. \n#Person1#: Maybe I should just get a tongue piercing! 
#Person1#: Louis, how is your knee today? Have you seen a doctor?\n#Person2#: I feel much better today. I went to the doctor and he told me it was not serious. I should be OK for Saturday's basketball game.\n#Person1#: Great. But why don't you have a good rest today? You can just practice throwing balls, but you shouldn't run.\n#Person2#: OK. Do you have any news about Michigan?\n#Person1#: Yes, I have some videos of their last three games. They're in my office. Shall we watch them together?\n#Person2#: That would be great. Let's go.
#Person1#: I'll be at a lunch meeting for the next hour and a half. Will you please tell anyone who calls that I will call them back later this afternoon? And if anyone comes to the office, it just have them wait until I come back.\n#Person2#: Yes, Mr. Roberts. What if they are there waiting for a long time? Should I offer them anything?\n#Person1#: You can show them the new video we made for the company.\n#Person2#: OK, I will do that, Mr. Roberts. I'll take care of everything while you're out.
#Person1#: So what do you want to do? Get another drink here or call it a night?\n#Person2#: I'll have another beer. Let me buy this round.\n#Person1#: OK. Thanks. So how was your date the other night?\n#Person2#: Great. Jim took me to the cinema to see a film. I think he's really nice. And he's got a cool job. He's a television producer. You know, he went to the National Film and Television School and he's been working at Channel 4 for a year now.\n#Person1#: Sounds impressive. So you think it might get serious?\n#Person2#: Yeah, we have a good connection. I think he's marriage material. We'll see how it goes, but I'm already thinking we could have a long term future ahead of us.\n#Person1#: Isn't it a bit early to talk about stuff like that? You've only been out with him twice so far.\n#Person2#: No, we've been out 3 times now and I'm seeing him again tomorrow. It's not easy finding someone you're attracted to and have good chemistry with. I don't see what's wrong with thinking about the future.\n#Person1#: Well, I'd be careful if I were you. You should get to know him better before talking about marriage.
#Person1#: I'd like to check in please.\n#Person2#: Do you have a reservation sir?\n#Person1#: Yes, the name is Robert, Robert Brown.\n#Person2#: Let me check the computer please. Yes, here it is Robert Brown. How many nights will you be staying?\n#Person1#: I will stay from Monday to Friday.\n#Person2#: That's four days. Smoking or non-smoking?\n#Person1#: A smoking room, please.\n#Person2#: OK, you don't mind facing the street?\n#Person1#: No that's no problem. But I do want to room with a good view of the ocean.\n#Person2#: The rooms with a better view will be a little more expensive. Are you OK with it?\n#Person1#: No problem. How much do you charge for that?\n#Person2#: $140 a night.\n#Person1#: Thank you very much.
#Person1#: Do you realize it's November already before you know it? Thanksgiving will be here.\n#Person2#: Shh, you're right. It's time we decided what we're going to do this year. Well do you feel like inviting your sister and her family over, otherwise I'd like to invite my brother and his family.\n#Person1#: I'd love to invite my sister's family. After all, they invited us last year.\n#Person2#: Good, that settled. Why don't you give your sister a call and see if they can come?\n#Person1#: Sure. Say Randy can you help me with the shopping? We need to get a Turkey.\n#Person2#: Right. Let's get a nice, big one. So we'll have plenty of leftovers to make sandwiches with.
#Person1#: Dad come and sit here.\n#Person2#: Oh good. We can watch the races together!\n#Person1#: Yes. look! There's William!\n#Person2#: Where?\n#Person1#: There! He's running in this race. He's the boy with the red shorts.\n#Person2#: Oh yes, he can run very fast. He's going to win, I think. Who's the boy with dark hair? He's coming second in the race.\n#Person1#: Oh that's Harry, he's very good at running too.\n#Person2#: Look at all the silver cups on the table.\n#Person1#: Yes, they are ready for the teams that win.\n#Person2#: Who's the older boy sitting next to the table?\n#Person1#: That's Michael, he has won lots of cups for running. He's going to give the cups to the children that win. Can you see my friend Kathy.\n#Person2#: No. Where is she?\n#Person1#: She is there near the drinks. She's entered the swimming competition.\n#Person2#: Who's the boy over there? Look he's hurt his leg.\n#Person1#: Oh, that's Richard. He fell in the jumping competition, I hope he'll be OK.
#Person1#: Glad you're back. How did the conference go, Chris?\n#Person2#: Uh, it was good. All the topic were interesting and the speakers were really good. The organization was a lot better this year, as well. I think having smaller number of people there made a big difference. You know you can make decisions a lot more quickly.\n#Person1#: Then how was the hotel?\n#Person2#: Ah, that was probably the only thing that people really complained about. The food in the restaurant wasn't very good and the service was slow. If we go back to the same hotel again, we'll have to find another restaurant.\n#Person1#: You're right. Anyway, I want to get a cup of coffee. Do you want to come?\n#Person2#: I'm done with coffee. I think I'll just go and have a cup of tea.
#Person1#: Good evening, what can I do for you?\n#Person2#: Good evening. I would like to buy a bottle of perfume.\n#Person1#: OK. We have many kinds of perfume here. You can choose freely.\n#Person2#: Which brand would you recommend? I don't want to buy one with quality problems.\n#Person1#: Don't worry, we have no such problems. How about this one? It sells very well.\n#Person2#: Umm, it smells good. How much is it?\n#Person1#: 400 yuan per bottle. And if you buy 2 bottles at the same time, you can get a 10% discount. We have other special offers as well. If you buy lipstick or face cream, you can get a free gift.\n#Person2#: Thanks. I just need perfume when I want to buy lipstick I will come here again.
#Person1#: I can't stand this heat. I can't get my attention to studying for the midterm exam. I guess I'll have to go to the library this afternoon.\n#Person2#: I don't blame you. This dormitory doesn't have air conditioning. I can't study, either. My roommate and I are thinking about moving out to the other dorm, or an apartment that has air conditioning.\n#Person1#: Oh, I thought about moving too. But if I want to live in an apartment, I have to pay a lot of money for electricity. Do you know an air conditioner is cheaper today than it was 10 years ago? On the other hand, electricity is a lot more expensive today.\n#Person2#: I didn't know that. How much do we have to pay for the electricity?\n#Person1#: 5 years ago, it was possible to run an air conditioner 24 hours a day for mere $20 a month. Today, the same air conditioner in the same house cost more than $40 a month.\n#Person2#: Oh no, that's really expensive. Well, I guess I'll tell my roommate will see about the other dorm. If it doesn't workout, we will sweat all summer.
#Person1#: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, we are happy you have all come out for our training workshop. Today we have a great line-up of speakers to talk to you. First on our program is a well-renown expert in the field of international economic development, Harvard's own Dr. James Smith. Dr. Smith has been involved in economic research for over twenty years, and has taught at Harvard since 1995. And now, without further adieu, we'd like to welcome Mr. James Smith.\n#Person2#: Thank you, Mr. Jackson, ladies and gentlemen, colleagues, friends. The subject of my talk is international relations in a morgen world. I plan to say a few words about the current situation in the Middle East and how it affects world economy. I'd like to give you an overview of the way that the economies of seemingly unrelated countries are intertwined. I've divided my talk into three parts, first an overview of international relations, second a discussion of current political situations, and lastly trends for the future. My presentation will take about two hours, but there will be a twenty-minute break in the middle. We'll stop for lunch at 12.
#Person1#: Can you tell me the best way to look for an apartment?\n#Person2#: The local newspaper has ads for housing.\n#Person1#: Is there any way to find a roommate to share an apartment with?\n#Person2#: Sometimes you can post an advertisement saying that you need a roommate.\n#Person1#: What do landlords charge for rent?\n#Person2#: Would you like an apartment for just yourself, or do you need it for two people?\n#Person1#: There are two of us, but we only need a one-bedroom apartment.\n#Person2#: You should be able to easily find that for twelve hundred dollars a month.\n#Person1#: I really would appreciate it if you could come look at apartments with me.\n#Person2#: Sure, I ' ll go look at apartments with you anytime you want.
#Person1#: So I'm on the fifth floor? How come this hotel has no fourth floor.\n#Person2#: Four is an unlucky number here, Peter. Four sounds like death in Chinese. Hotels often have no fourth floor.\n#Person1#: I see. Oh, I know what I wanted to ask. How much should I tip this guy?\n#Person2#: People don't usually tip here, but you can. Fifty dollars should be more enough.
#Person1#: I ' m fed up with marriage.\n#Person2#: Why do you say so? Everyone admires that you have a good wife.\n#Person1#: Oh, no. When we were poor, we often tried our best to make ends meet. It was a hard time.\n#Person2#: But now you are rich.\n#Person1#: And we have some squabbles on some boring things.\n#Person2#: This is ordinary marriage life.
#Person1#: Hi, is this the Resume Writing Workshop?\n#Person2#: Yes, this is the Resume Writing Workshop. Welcome!\n#Person1#: I really don't know that much about putting together a resume.\n#Person2#: It's easy. Don't worry about it.\n#Person1#: What's the most important part?\n#Person2#: Well, the most important thing we need to do is make sure that our name and contact information are across the top.\n#Person1#: What comes next?\n#Person2#: You can either list your job experience next or your education--whichever is the most impressive should be first.\n#Person1#: Can I list my interests next?\n#Person2#: Sure, that would be a good place for them.
#Person1#: Professor, where's Canada?\n#Person2#: Canada is north of here.\n#Person1#: Can you show me on the map?\n#Person2#: Sure. Look here. Canada is north of the United States.\n#Person1#: Oh, I see. Where's Mexico?\n#Person2#: Mexico is south of the United States.\n#Person1#: How about Connecticut? Where's that?\n#Person2#: Connecticut is east of New York.\n#Person1#: What state is west of Pennsylvania?\n#Person2#: Ohio.\n#Person1#: OK, Where's Los Angeles?\n#Person2#: Los Angeles is in California. It's southeast of San Francisco.\n#Person1#: Where's Boston.\n#Person2#: Boston is in the northeast part of the country.\n#Person1#: Where is Las Vegas?\n#Person2#: Las Vegas is in the southwest.
#Person1#: Is everything ready for the Christmas party?\n#Person2#: Almost. I'Ve put up the decorations, and we'Ve decorated the Christmas tree with plenty of tinsel and baubles.\n#Person1#: I like the big star on the top of the tree. I'll put the presents under the tree later, how's the food.\n#Person2#: I'Ve prepared most of it already and we'Ve got plenty of snack foods-you know, crisps, biscuits, and things. Are you going to make the punch?\n#Person1#: Yes. I'Ve bought all the things to go in it. It won't take long to make. How many people are coming to the party?\n#Person2#: I think everyone will be coming. Dave don't come because he has to go to his parent's home and they live in Scotland.\n#Person1#: Do we have Christmas pudding?\n#Person2#: Yes, we do. I hope we have enough for everyone. Did you send out all your Christmas cards in time?\n#Person1#: Yes, I did. I send most of them a week ago. I'Ve brought some with me to the party to give to people in person.\n#Person2#: I did the same. I spent hours yesterday evening wrapping presents. I hope I didn't forget to buy anyone something!\n#Person1#: I hope you didn't forget mine!
#Person1#: Oh, Mary, come in, please. I'm so happy to see you.\n#Person2#: Happy birthday, George. Many happy returns of the day. Here's a present for you.\n#Person1#: Oh, thank you, Mary. You're so nice.\n#Person2#: I hope you like it. Oh, have the other guys arrived?\n#Person1#: They're all waiting for you. Let's join them. I'm going to cut the cake soon.\n#Person2#: Let's go.
#Person1#: Jason, it's your turn.\n#Person2#: I hope I get an easy question like you did.\n#Person1#: You rolled a four. Let's see. . . you landed on Foreign Films.\n#Person2#: Oh, great. That's just my luck! I hate those arty movies.\n#Person1#: Well, too bad. So, what foreign film won an Oscar in 1993?\n#Person2#: Oh, please! I have no idea.\n#Person1#: The answer is Belle Opaque. It's a Spanish movie, and the title means The Age of Beauty in English.
#Person1#: What is your great struck?\n#Person2#: I think I'm very good at planning. I manage my time perfectly, so that I can always get things done on time.\n#Person1#: Why do you think you be a good fit or this job?\n#Person2#: Because I'm very competent in this area.\n#Person1#: Can you working under pressure?\n#Person2#: Yes, I work well under pressure and find it dimly. However, I believe planning and probable management of my time can reduce tight deadlines.\n#Person1#: Are you more a follower or a leader?\n#Person2#: I don't try to go ahead of people and lead them, I'd rather cooperate with everybody else and get the job done by working together.
#Person1#: Can I help you, Madam?\n#Person2#: Yes, I'd like to exchange some US dollars into RIB.\n#Person1#: How much would you like to exchange?\n#Person2#: What's the exchange rate for RIB?\n#Person1#: It's US 100 for RMB 802 today.\n#Person2#: I'd like to exchange 3, 000.\n#Person1#: Fill out this exchange memo, please.\n#Person2#: Yes. Here you are.\n#Person1#: Wait a second, please. . . These are 24, 060 RMB and the receipt, please check them.\n#Person2#: All right, thank you so much, good-bye.\n#Person1#: Good-bye.
#Person1#: we'd like to rent a flat near the university.\n#Person2#: are you looking for somewhere for two people?\n#Person1#: yes, we are. obviously, we'd like something as cheap as possible. we've heard that there are places for 80 to 100 pounds a month.\n#Person2#: yes, there are several place available in that price range near the university. do you have any other requirements?\n#Person1#: net really, no. we'd preferably like to live in a quiet street.\n#Person2#: how many rooms do you need in the flat?\n#Person1#: we'll need two bedrooms. the kitchen and dining room can be separate or combined.\n#Person2#: ok. i've got a list of place that fit your requirements. let's just go through them. the first on the list costs 80 pounds a month, but it's on a noisy street and it's a little far from t\n#Person1#: how far away is it from the campus?\n#Person2#: it's about two miles away. that might be a little far to walk. here's one that's about half a mile from the campus. the cost is 100 pounds a month and it's on a small street, just off a\n#Person1#: that sounds ideal. can we go to have a look at it? we'd like to see it before making a final decision.\n#Person2#: of course. i'm not very busy at the moment. if you can wait for about 15 or 20 minutes. i can take you there.\n#Person1#: thank you. that would be great.
#Person1#: Can I get you any dessert?\n#Person2#: Yes, I'd like to try the blueberry pie.\n#Person1#: Excellent choice. ( He brings her the pie. After she finishes, the waiter comes back. ) Would you like anything else?\n#Person2#: No, I'm stuffed. I'm ready for the check.\n#Person1#: Here you are. Thank you and have a nice evening.\n#Person2#: Thank you.
#Person1#: When the interview finally comes to an end, the interviewee will probably breathe a sigh of relief.\n#Person2#: Still, you should not let down your guard. Some details should be paid attention to.\n#Person1#: At this moment you can thank the interviewer again for the opportunity of the interview.\n#Person2#: You can also ask the interviewer about your performance today.\n#Person1#: Don't forget to ask when you can receive a reply.\n#Person2#: And it's best to ask about the second interview if necessary.\n#Person1#: You should state politely that you will wait for the results patiently.\n#Person2#: You can ask questions about the position you are applying for.\n#Person1#: In this case, you should remember to give thanks for the reply you get.\n#Person2#: Of course.\n#Person1#: Just say goodbye to the interviewer before you leave.\n#Person2#: Besides, remember to make acknowledgments through an E-mail or a call.
#Person1#: What do you think this flat?\n#Person2#: It's not really all that good. The bedroom is a little small for us.\n#Person1#: Small? But it should be enough for our needs, I think.\n#Person2#: But there's no hot water after 10 at night. Sometimes I like to have a hot shower before bed, especially in the winter, it feels good.\n#Person1#: That's true, but I love the living room, it's huge and filled with sunshine.\n#Person2#: True, and I like the kitchen. It's new and well equipped.\n#Person1#: It has a great balcony with an incredible view of the park.\n#Person2#: You are right. The view is spectacular. But that bedroom is so small. We'd never be able to fit all of our stuff in there.\n#Person1#: May be we could get some new furniture, better stuff.\n#Person2#: I haven't thought of that.
#Person1#: Hello. Mr. Rodriguez?\n#Person2#: Yes. Is this Paula?\n#Person1#: Yes, sir. I'Ve just dropped those slides off at the Winthrop office. Do you need anything else while I'm out?\n#Person2#: No, that's all right. Paula. Why don't you get something to eat, and I'll see you this afternoon.
#Person1#: It's hot today, shall we go for a dip at the beach?\n#Person2#: That's a good idea. Let's bring our trunks and towels.\n#Person1#: Would you like to swim in the swimming pool or at the beach?\n#Person2#: I'd prefer the pool.\n#Person1#: OK. Let's pay the entrance fee and change our clothes in the dressing room.\n#Person2#: What style do you use?\n#Person1#: Well, I use breast stroke for long distance, crawl or free style for short distance and back stroke just for fun.
#Person1#: Hello, is there anything I can do for you?\n#Person2#: Yes. I would like to check in.\n#Person1#: Have you made a reservation?\n#Person2#: Yes. I am Belen.\n#Person1#: So your room number is 201. Are you a member of our hotel?\n#Person2#: No, what's the difference?\n#Person1#: Well, we offer a 10 % charge for our members.
#Person1#: To which gate do I need to go to catch connection flight Ll 01 to Madrid?\n#Person2#: Go to gate 18. The plane is boarding now. You should hurry up.\n#Person1#: Show me the fastest way to get there.\n#Person2#: Instead of walking. you can take this shuttle to get you there faster.\n#Person1#: Do you think the plane will leave without me?\n#Person2#: No, I'll call the attendants at the gate to tell them that you are on your way.\n#Person1#: Thank you so much. I really appreciate that.
#Person1#: What wrong with you? You look pale?\n#Person2#: I'm not sure. I feel hot and cold.\n#Person1#: When did the trouble start?\n#Person2#: I was sick most of the night.\n#Person1#: It sounds like you're coming down with the flu. Let me take your temperature.\n#Person2#: Have I got high fever?\n#Person1#: Yes. Thirty-eight point seven. Do you have a headache, chestache or throat pain?\n#Person2#: Yes, I have.\n#Person1#: Now, Let me have a look at you. I'd like to listen to your chest. Breathe then, deep breath, that's it. Cough, now again. I want to exam your throat too. Open wide, say A.\n#Person2#: ah.\n#Person1#: Yes, It does look a bit sore. Let's take your extra way of your chest and give you a few tests.\n#Person2#: All right, thanks.\n#Person1#: The tests showed nothing wrong. a slight by infection.\n#Person2#: What shall I do today?\n#Person1#: I'm giving you some antibiotic and aspirin. Taking aspirin when you'Ve got a fever and take one antibiotic until four hours and go home lie in bed for two days. Take some water then you feel better.
#Person1#: Good morning, sir. How may I help you?\n#Person2#: I'd like to open an account.\n#Person1#: Certainly, sir. Would you like to open a time deposit savings account or a checking account?\n#Person2#: Actually, I'd like to open one of each, if that's possible.\n#Person1#: No problem, sir. What sort of time deposit account would you like to open?\n#Person2#: What are my choices?\n#Person1#: The minimum time period is three months. The longer the period, the higher the interest rate. If you withdraw your money before time is up, there are penalties.
#Person1#: How much tea are you going to order?\n#Person2#: We want to order 3, 000 cases and hope to deliver the goods in two equal lots.\n#Person1#: When do you want to deliver the goods?\n#Person2#: We'd like you to execute the first delivery by June 30 and the second delivery by August 15.\n#Person1#: I'm sorry, but June 30 is quite soon. I can't guarantee 1 500 cases, I'd prefer the first shipment to be 1, 000 cases and the next 2, 000 cases.\n#Person2#: I can agree to that.\n#Person1#: Let me affirm this again - the first shipment of 1, 000 cases, to be delivered in 27 days, by June 30, and the second shipment of 2, 000 cases by August 15. Right?\n#Person2#: Right.\n#Person1#: Well, if there's nothing else, I think we've settled everything.\n#Person2#: Let's hope it's the beginning of a long and prosperous relationship.
#Person1#: Good morning, Laura, what do you want to talk to me about?\n#Person2#: Good morning, professor Smith. I want to talk to you about changing my major. You see, I've decided to work in art museum when I graduate in three years, I think I should change my major to art history.\n#Person1#: You know, Laura, I think you should give this decision after some more thought. You've do well in your years of business major, the sign is, all organizations need good managers.\n#Person2#: That's true, but wasn't I still have to know a lot about art?\n#Person1#: Why not attend a few lectures in art history and try working a few hours a week as a volunteer at the local art museum to see if you really like working there.
#Person1#: Jane, what would you do if you were on vacation overseas and lost all your money and credit cards?\n#Person2#: Well, I guess I'd probably sell my watch and camera... Or I might get a job as a waitress somewhere till I made enough money to buy a plane ticket to return home.
#Person1#: I'm sorry to have kept you waiting for such a long time. I didn't think the meeting would be so long.\n#Person2#: That's all right, Dr. Green. I've got the data you required and a few reference books which I think may be useful to your representation at the conference.
#Person1#: Morning, Mr. Roberts, have you been to that new shop in the High Street.\n#Person2#: Good morning, Mrs. White. Yes, I just thought I pop in and browse around, seeing if there is anything I like. I must say I'm very impressed. They have a very good literature section and there is a little care where you can go and read a book in peace.\n#Person1#: Have they got any nice love stories? That's what I really like, a bit of romance and excitement.
#Person1#: Jane, I hear that you are leaving school now. What do you want to do? Have you made up your mind yet?\n#Person2#: No, not yet. But I think I'm going to take up singing.\n#Person1#: Any special reasons?\n#Person2#: Yes. It's because I am good at singing songs. All my classmates say so. Besides, singing is quite interesting and you can meet a lot of people.\n#Person1#: And you will have to please them too.\n#Person2#: Well, you do in any job, don't you?\n#Person1#: And what do your parents think about it?\n#Person2#: They don't quite agree with my idea. That is the only trouble.\n#Person1#: Have they got any other plans for you, then?\n#Person2#: Yes, um...they're trying to send me to an art college because they want me to be an actress.\n#Person1#: Then what will you do?\n#Person2#: Er...I haven't decided yet. But I usually get my own way in the end.
#Person1#: Where did you put my new red tie?\n#Person2#: It's right there in the cupboard with your other ties.\n#Person1#: There's a green one and a couple of brown ones, but no red one.\n#Person2#: Here it is in your drawer. You must have put it there when you brought it home.\n#Person1#: I suppose so. We'd better hurry up or we're going to be late. The Smiths said to come at 7:00.\n#Person2#: Oh, it's 6:24 now. Sue isn't here to take care of the children yet.\n#Person1#: She shall be here at 6:40. That still gives us time to get there.\n#Person2#: Who else is coming tonight?\n#Person1#: The Browns and the Franks. And Mrs. Johnson's sister will be there too.\n#Person2#: Well. I think we'd better go down. Sue should be here pretty soon.
#Person1#: By the way, do you know what time it is?\n#Person2#: Well, it's a quarter to two.\n#Person1#: Oh, I've got to go.\n#Person2#: See Linda in the library?\n#Person1#: No. Actually I'm going to meet with Professor Smith at ten past two. You may continue our project discussion with Michael.\n#Person2#: All right.
#Person1#: Jim, are you planning to buy that nice blue Ford car you looked at last week?\n#Person2#: I'm afraid that's impossible because I haven't been able to come up with the cash, and someone else has already made a down payment on it.
#Person1#: Did you hear Jakie's going to work in another department? We need to have a really good party so that we can send her off really well. So, what shall we do?\n#Person2#: Why don't we have a surprise party, Maggie?\n#Person1#: That's a good idea. We could go to the Holiday Inn Hotel.\n#Person2#: That's too expensive. Maybe we can ask Carrie to make a cake.\n#Person1#: Yeah, let's do that. Perhaps we could just give the party in the office and put up some balloons.\n#Person2#: That's great. I think we should also buy a really big card, a huge card, and we should get everybody to sign it.\n#Person1#: Shall we have some music?\n#Person2#: I was thinking exactly that myself. But ...
#Person1#: Hi, Mary. I haven't seen you in ages! I heard that you and Daniel are getting married on August 8th, the opening day of the 2008 Olympic Games. Is it true? \n#Person2#: Yes, it is. We've been dating for over 7 years. We have decided to get married on a special day and we think August 8th, 2008 is a red-letter day. \n#Person1#: Good for you! It sounds like you've done a lot of planning in a very short time. \n#Person2#: Yes, there is a lot of to be taken care of---wedding photos, wedding dress, catering, transport, hotel, etc... \n#Person1#: Is everything ready now? \n#Person2#: Almost. The only thing that isn't ready is the hotel. As a lot of people have chosen that day to get married, it is hard to find a hotel that isn't too expensive. \n#Person1#: Have you tried The Peninsula Palace Beijing? My wedding reception was held there and they did an excellent job. \n#Person2#: Yes, we called, but it is booked up. The only choice is the Regent Beijing but we haven't made up our minds yet. \n#Person1#: It's an excellent hotel. A friend of mine had her wedding reception there and sasid it was perfect, though very expensive. \n#Person2#: That's why we want to have a look at other hotels. We don't want to spend too much on an extravagant wedding reception. \n#Person1#: I guess you're right. I can help you ask other hotels. I am sure there are probably some available. \n#Person2#: Thank you. \n#Person1#: My pleasure. 
#Person1#: Can you help me set up my voicemail message? I just got this service and I am not really sure what I am supposed to say. \n#Person2#: Sure! You just basically gotta let the caller know who they called, and ask them for their contact information so you can call them back. \n#Person1#: Ok, so can I say, 'This is Abby's voicemail. I will call you later, so leave me your name and number'. \n#Person2#: That's more or less the idea, but try something that sounds more friendly. \n#Person1#: Ok, so how about this, 'This is Abby and I am really happy you called! I promise I will give you a ring as soon as I can, so please leave me your name and number. Talk to you soon! '. \n#Person2#: A little too friendly Abby. Just say this, 'Hi, you have reached Abby. I am unable to answer your call right now, but if you leave me your name and phone number, I will get back to you as soon as possible. Thanks'. \n#Person1#: That's perfect! Can you say that again and record it for me? 
#Person1#: For our lunch meeting with the investors, do we have to make a reservation at the restaurant or do we just show up? \n#Person2#: Usually for lunch, we don't have to reserve a table, they should allow walk-ins. But to be on the safe side, I'll order a table for half-past twelve. Will that suit your schedule? \n#Person1#: I've arranged to meet them at the restaurant at twelve. Can you make the reservation a little earlier? If we start earlier, it will give us more time for a longer lunch. \n#Person2#: Are you planning on treating the investors to a full-course meal? \n#Person1#: Yes, we'll start with appetizers, follow with a soup and salad course, then main dishes of prime RMB or cordon bleu chicken, and finish up with a delicious rich dessert of some sort. \n#Person2#: That'll be pretty heavy for a mid-day meal, don't you think? \n#Person1#: As along as we stay away from anything alcoholic, we should be okay. \n#Person2#: With your prime RMB and chicken choices, you'd better hope nobody's vegetarian. \n#Person1#: We can make some special arrangement if we need to. After all, it's the company who is footing the bill. 
#Person1#: Did your company go union? I heard that many companies in out industry are being unionized, so It's getting harder and harder to compete on a level playing field. \n#Person2#: Yes, we're hopping on the bandwagon and signing up for the union. Mostly people are pretty happy about it... I guess it depends on if you are in management or in the labor force. \n#Person1#: Management isn't looking on the labor unions too favorably, I'd guess. I don't blame them... labor unions can really put the squeeze on the executives. \n#Person2#: Sure... but it's probably better for the workers, because the union's whole purpose is to look out for the little guys. The only way that the little guys can take on the big bosses is if they unite. Labor unions are all about getting a voice for the underdog. 
#Person1#: The country is strong only in appearance. Don't you think so? \n#Person2#: Yes. In fact there are quite a large number of people who have no food to eat and no place to live in. \n#Person1#: You can say that again. The government must open it's eyes to the fact. 
#Person1#: Guess who I saw yesterday? \n#Person2#: Who? \n#Person1#: My cousin Monik. Have you seen her lately? \n#Person2#: Not for a couple of years. What happened to her? \n#Person1#: Nothing exactly. She's grown into a very attractive young lady. \n#Person2#: Oh, she is. \n#Person1#: You know, her long lovely blond hair and beautiful blue eyes really make her stand out from others. \n#Person2#: Not surprising. I bet she's very tall and slim. \n#Person1#: Yean. Around five feet five inches tall. 
#Person1#: Can I help you, Madam? \n#Person2#: Yes. I'd like to buy a sweater for my husband. Which style is the latest? \n#Person1#: These are all the latest fashion. How do you like this white turtleneck one? \n#Person2#: I like this style. But do you have any other colors? I feel that this color doesn't suit his complexion. \n#Person1#: We also have it in grey. \n#Person2#: Great! I will take it. And could you suggest a pair of trousers to match this sweater? \n#Person1#: It's my pleasure. I think this pair of jeans will suit the sweater well. \n#Person2#: Let me see. Yes, they are perfectly matched! 
#Person1#: Do you like this dress, madam? \n#Person2#: I like the colour very much. It's a lovely dress, but it's too small for me. \n#Person1#: What about this one? It's a lovely dress. It's very smart. Short skirts are in fashion now. Would you like to try it? \n#Person2#: All right. I'm afraid this green dress is too small for me as well. It's smaller than the blue one. I don't like the colour either. It doesn't suit me at all. I think the blue dress is prettier. Co \n#Person1#: I'm afraid I haven't got a larger dress. This is the largest dress in the shop. 
#Person1#: It looks delicious. I will order it. \n#Person2#: I am sorry, sir, it's for 4 persons to have. I think it's too large for you. \n#Person1#: Would you please make it for a single person? \n#Person2#: Sorry, sir. We have never done that before. 
#Person1#: Can I help you, sir? \n#Person2#: Yes, I've been sitting here for a few minutes. I'm waiting for someone to put gas in my car. \n#Person1#: I'm sorry, sir. But this is the self-service pump. \n#Person2#: Self-service? \n#Person1#: Yes. You must fill up the car yourself. \n#Person2#: Are you serious? \n#Person1#: Yes. Are you traveling here? \n#Person2#: Yes, I'm from Taiwan. I never heard of a gas station where you fill up your own car. \n#Person1#: In America, most gas stations are like this. \n#Person2#: Do I really have to do it? I don't know how. \n#Person1#: Well, since this is your first time, I will do it for you. But next time, if you want a full-service gas station, you should look at the sign. \n#Person2#: What sign? \n#Person1#: Under the sign for the gas station, there will be a smaller sign that says Self-Serve or Full-Service. And some gas stations have both. But if they have both, some pumps will be self-serve and some will be full-serve. You have to look at the signs. \n#Person2#: I see. 
#Person1#: Hi, Jack. It's several months since I last saw you.\n#Person2#: Hi, Sue. I've been busy with my book.\n#Person1#: Haven't you finished it yet?\n#Person2#: I will have in a few days.\n#Person1#: Are you going to advertise it yourself?\n#Person2#: Hmm...Some friends suggested I should, but I'm still in 2 minds about it.\n#Person1#: If I were you, I would.\n#Person2#: Thank you for your advice. I think I'll market it.
#Person1#: Do you have any plans during this summer?\n#Person2#: Well, I want to get a summer job, I'd like to save money for a vacation.\n#Person1#: Really? Where would you like to go?\n#Person2#: I'd love to travel to Latin America.\n#Person1#: What about you Melissa?\n#Person2#: Well, I'm not going to get a job right away. First, I want to go to Spain and Portugal.\n#Person1#: Sounds great, but how are you going to pay for it?\n#Person2#: I know I can't ask my parents for money anymore. So I'll borrow some money from my brother. I have a good excuse. I plan to take courses in Spanish and Portuguese.\n#Person1#: Oh, I'm tired of studying.\n#Person2#: So am I. But I also hope to take people on tourist to Latin America. Why don't you come on my first tour?\n#Person1#: Count me in.
#Person1#: Hello Brian speaking\n#Person2#: Hi Brian, it's Mary here. Hope I haven't troubled you at such a time.\n#Person1#: No no. I was just watching TV.\n#Person2#: Oh good. Did you have a good weekend?\n#Person1#: Yeah, it was good. I went to the cinema with some friends yesterday. What about you?\n#Person2#: Not too bad. Hey actually I'm calling because it's my birthday this Saturday. I was wondering if you would come.\n#Person1#: That sounds good. What time?\n#Person2#: Is 7:00 o'clock OK? David won't finish work until 6:30.\n#Person1#: Oh sorry I'm afraid I can't make it. Is 7:30 alright?\n#Person2#: Sure. 7:30 then.\n#Person1#: Do you want me to bring something like a cake or some drinks?\n#Person2#: Oh no. I'll get the food and everything. Just come and help me celebrate.\n#Person1#: Well, in that case, I'll invite you to a piano concert next Friday.\n#Person2#: That would be great, thanks.\n#Person1#: OK. I'll book the tickets now.
#Person1#: Excuse me.\n#Person2#: Yeah.\n#Person1#: You didn't see someone pick up a blue sports bag, did you?\n#Person2#: Sorry?\n#Person1#: Yeah, a Big Blue nylon sports bag with a big white Adidas logo on the side.\n#Person2#: I said no.\n#Person1#: I only put it down for a moment when I went into the restroom, then I came out and...\n#Person2#: I can't help you.\n#Person1#: I don't believe it. I had a brand new racket in there and 10 new balls and er...\n#Person2#: Well, these are public courts Madam, anyone can walk in here, you should be more careful.
#Person1#: Hi, Peter. What's up? You look upset.\n#Person2#: We are planning a trip through the western states and want to take our dog with us. We have trouble finding a hotel that allows dogs, so we'll probably have to leave the dog at our neighbor's house.\n#Person1#: I saw a program on TV that said there were more and more pet friendly hotels now. If a hotel advertises as pet friendly, it means you can bring your dog.\n#Person2#: I don't think my father knows about that. Where can we find more information?\n#Person1#: Peter, everything can be found on the Internet.\n#Person2#: Oh yeah, I'll do it right away.
#Person1#: Would you like to order now, sir?\n#Person2#: Yes, please. I like the steak and mushrooms.\n#Person1#: How would you like your steak? Rare, medium or well done?\n#Person2#: I'd like it medium, please.\n#Person1#: What kind of potatoes would you like to go with that? Mashed, boiled or baked?\n#Person2#: I think I'll have baked potatoes, and I'll have an iced tea with a lemon on the side, please.\n#Person1#: Good, and would you care for soup or salad to start with?\n#Person2#: I'd like a cream and onion soup, please.\n#Person1#: Will you be having dessert today, sir?\n#Person2#: I want to skip dessert. That's all, thank you.\n#Person1#: OK, I'll be with you in a moment.
#Person1#: Excuse me, is this the Auto Consumer Loan Center?\n#Person2#: Yes. Is there anything I can do for you?\n#Person1#: Could you tell me something about the terms and interest rates for personal automobile consumer loan?\n#Person2#: The deadline is normally no more than 5 years with the interest adopted according to the corresponding lending rates announced by the PBC.\n#Person1#: I plan to take the loan for 3 years.\n#Person2#: Well, the yearly interest rate is 5.49 % for 3 years. I'm sure you are qualified to apply for this loan.\n#Person1#: What about the loan repayment?\n#Person2#: You may choose a repayment pattern by consulting with our bank, for example, payment of equal amount of principal or of principal and interest on monthly installments.\n#Person1#: Does that mean I should deposit sufficient money to my account prior to the monthly payment date so that you can directly deduct the repayment of the principal and interest?\n#Person2#: Exactly. You are permitted to effect and early payment in part or in full with the consent of our bank.\n#Person1#: That's very thoughtful of you. Thank you so much.\n#Person2#: You're welcome.
#Person1#: What may I help you with?\n#Person2#: I need to file a complaint.\n#Person1#: What is your complaint about?\n#Person2#: I got robbed.\n#Person1#: When did this happen?\n#Person2#: It happened this morning.\n#Person1#: What was taken?\n#Person2#: My wallet and cell phone.\n#Person1#: Did you get a good look at the person who robbed you?\n#Person2#: I sure did.\n#Person1#: Would you able to pick him out of a line-up?\n#Person2#: That shouldn't be a problem.
#Person1#: Well, Peter, you have to do better than that next time, won ' t you?\n#Person2#: Have I really got to do those exams again, Dad?\n#Person1#: Of course, you have. You must try harder this time.\n#Person2#: And must I go back to school?\n#Person1#: No, you needn ' t do that. You ' d better get a part-time job somewhere and go to evening classes.\n#Person2#: But Dad, I should be working full-time at my age. I ' m nearly 17.\n#Person1#: You ought to have worked harder then you wouldn ' t have failed your exams. You have to take a job and study.\n#Person2#: What else I ' Ve got to do? Join the army?\n#Person1#: Who knows! That might come to later.
#Person1#: Have you got any experience in advertising?\n#Person2#: Yes, I have been working in the Public Relations Section of a company in the past two years. I plan the advertising campaign and cooperate the work of artists and typographers. Sometimes I have to do the work of a specialist when there ' s something urgent.\n#Person1#: Do you have any practical experience as a secretary?\n#Person2#: Yes, sir. I acted as a secretary in an insurance company.\n#Person1#: Would you tell me the essential qualities a secretary should maintain?\n#Person2#: Well, to begin with, I would say she needs to be diligent, and the second point is that she has to do a lot of things on her own initiative. Finally, she can make notes in shorthand and types and has the skills in report writing, summary writing, keep minutes at meetings, and so on. Most important of all is that she seems to have a better memory than average.\n#Person1#: Have you had any experience with computer?\n#Person2#: Yes, I studied in a computer training program, and can process data through the computer.\n#Person1#: That's fine. What about operating the fax and duplicator?\n#Person2#: I can handle them without any trouble\n#Person1#: What have you learned from jobs you have held?\n#Person2#: Above all, I have learned that what is good for the company is good for me. So I follow the instructions strictly and always keep my boss informed.\n#Person1#: Very good.
#Person1#: Were you at the scene during the robbery?\n#Person2#: Yes, I was, Officer.\n#Person1#: Were you able to see a lot?\n#Person2#: I was there as it happened.\n#Person1#: What happened?\n#Person2#: The robber came in with a gun.\n#Person1#: Could you see his face?\n#Person2#: He had a mask over his face.\n#Person1#: Was he with someone else?\n#Person2#: He was alone.\n#Person1#: Would you be willing to come down to the station for further questioning?\n#Person2#: I would be happy to.
#Person1#: Which church do you attend?\n#Person2#: I am Mormon, so I go to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.\n#Person1#: What's the difference between this and other Churches?\n#Person2#: Mormons believe that, after the death of Christ and the death of the Apostles 10, their church Christ founded became corrupt and the authority of Christ on earth was lost to men. In 1830, a prophet named Joseph Smith was brought up by God to restore the church.\n#Person1#: Then does that mean the other churches are corrupt?\n#Person2#: That means that they all have parts of the original gospel, but not all.\n#Person1#: Do you believe that Mormons have all of it?\n#Person2#: Yes.\n#Person1#: Why do you really go to church?\n#Person2#: We gather together to encourage each other, because we have common beliefs. We come together and call it church.
#Person1#: Susan, good evening. Why are you so dressed up?\n#Person2#: I am on my way out to a New Year's banquet. How do I look? Is my make-up OK?\n#Person1#: You look great. Your make-up is perfect.\n#Person2#: Do you think I should wear a different dress?\n#Person1#: No, the one you have on looks fabulous, especially with your hair like that.\n#Person2#: Thanks for saying. Do you have any ideas which necklace I should wear?\n#Person1#: With that dress I'd say your white diamond necklace would look perfect.\n#Person2#: Thanks for helping out. Now that I'm ready, what are you doing tonight?\n#Person1#: Not much, just a house party with some friends.\n#Person2#: Sounds fun. Anyone I know?\n#Person1#: Yeah, most of the people are from our office.\n#Person2#: Sounds Like I'm missing out on a good time. Oh, well, there is always next year.\n#Person1#: I'm sure you'll have fun no matter where you go. Remember to take your bag.
#Person1#: Excuse me, miss. I'm Bob.\n#Person2#: I'm Amy. How do you do?\n#Person1#: I'm very glad to meet you. May I have this dance with you?\n#Person2#: Certainly! I suppose you dance often.\n#Person1#: No, I don't often dance. Isn't this a wonderful party?\n#Person2#: Yes, I'm glad I have come.\n#Person1#: How do you like fox-trot?\n#Person2#: I like it very much.\n#Person1#: You dance beautifully.\n#Person2#: Thank you. It's lucky that I have got a good partner.\n#Person1#: Thank you.
#Person1#: What are you reading?\n#Person2#: It's an article about language. It talks about the idea of having a single global language.\n#Person1#: It seems that English already is the main global language. Does the article suggest that there should be an artificial language like Esperanto as the world language.\n#Person2#: Actually, it suggest English. The main argument is that English is already being studied as a second language in most countries-china, India, mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, and japan, so beginning again\n#Person1#: Does the article say anything about other language? How will they survive in an English-speaking world?\n#Person2#: The article points out that many languages have been lost and will be lost, but others will continue to be used for generation, even if English continues to be the dominant language.
#Person1#: This place is great. I'm surprised there are so many things here.\n#Person2#: Yes, but it takes a while to find things. It's not organized as carefully as a regular store.\n#Person1#: What's the difference between an outlet and a regular store?\n#Person2#: Usually a clothes company will send their overstock to an outlet. The prices are very low. But you may find faulty products here too.\n#Person1#: Faulty products?\n#Person2#: Yes. Sometimes the fault is very small ; if you have a needle and thread, you can fix it yourself. So it's a good deal to buy it.\n#Person1#: Oh, that's easy for me. I think it's really a good deal.\n#Person2#: Yes. You can save a lot of money in this way.\n#Person1#: That's great for me. Look, children's clothes! I'd like to buy some winter clothes for my son and daughter.\n#Person2#: Why not buy the sweater? It only costs 30 Yuan.\n#Person1#: Yes, I'll take it. Are there any jeans? Xiaohui's jeans are always dirty. I also need four pairs of slippers.\n#Person2#: How many do you want to buy?\n#Person1#: I ought to make the most of it while I'm here, don't you think?\n#Person2#: You're right.
#Person1#: Steven, why are you so depressed?\n#Person2#: I'm feeling very sad. I just read the newspaper.\n#Person1#: What's the news?\n#Person2#: According to the newspaper, the town was razed by an earthquake and more than 10 thousand people died in the earthquake.\n#Person1#: It's horrible.\n#Person2#: Yeah, we have to do something to help the people in the stricken area.\n#Person1#: Yes. How about donating some money?\n#Person2#: It's a good idea. But where can we donate money?\n#Person1#: Just find the answer through Internet.\n#Person2#: Yes, let's do it now.
#Person1#: Can I help you?\n#Person2#: Yes, I need to buy a computer for this semester. I was told it is cheaper to buy computers here.\n#Person1#: Well, you heard right. You can get an excellent deal on a new computer here. We have great discounts for students.\n#Person2#: I don't know much about computers. But I know I want a desktop computer with a lot of memory. And I need a printer.\n#Person1#: Well, first let's consider your computer. Here, for example, is a system I highly recommend--the Power Macintosh G3. It comes with 64 megabytes of total memory.\n#Person2#: Is that a lot? Sixty-four?\n#Person1#: Yes, it is. It should be enough for any student needs you might have. What department are you in?\n#Person2#: History.\n#Person1#: Well, so you will mostly be using word processing, for writing papers. I recommend the Corel Word Perfect program for word processing. We can talk about software later. Let's talk about your\n#Person2#: Thirty percent?\n#Person1#: Yes.\n#Person2#: Wow. That's really good. And you think this is really a good system for a graduate student?\n#Person1#: Yes. It's an excellent system.\n#Person2#: Hmm. Hey, wait. This has an Apple on it. Is this an Apple computer?\n#Person1#: Yes, it's a Macintosh. It's Apple. Macintosh and Apple are the same thing.\n#Person2#: I don't want Macintosh. I want PC.\n#Person1#: I'm sorry, but our university computer center only sells Macintosh equipment.\n#Person2#: What? Are you serious?\n#Person1#: Yes.\n#Person2#: But nobody uses Macintosh!\n#Person1#: That's not true. Most of the students and professors in the university here use Macintosh. They find it is better for writing and word-processing, and that is what students mostly do. Ma\n#Person2#: Yes, I'm from Taiwan.\n#Person1#: Well, I know that in most Asian countries Apple is not very popular. But here in America, especially in universities and publishing companies, Apple is very commonly used.\n#Person2#: But I need a computer that can handle writing in Chinese.\n#Person1#: There are several Chinese writing programs you can use with Macintosh. Chinese is no problem for Apple.\n#Person2#: Hmm. I think I should ask some of my friends for advice before I make a decision. I'm sorry.\n#Person1#: No, don't be sorry. It's reasonable to ask your friends. But believe me, most of the students here in the university--Asian students included--most of them use Apple.\n#Person2#: Well, thanks for your advice. I will probably come back later.\n#Person1#: You're very welcome. Here is my card, if you need any help.
#Person1#: Excuse me, can you tell me which is Bob Rice's office?\n#Person2#: Sure. It's the third office down this hall. Are you looking for Bob?\n#Person1#: Yes. He told me to come by this morning.\n#Person2#: I'm sorry, but he's not in the office now. Do you have an appointment?\n#Person1#: An appointment?\n#Person2#: Yes. What time did he expect you?\n#Person1#: He said I should come by this morning. He didn't give me a time. He said I could come any time before noon.\n#Person2#: I see. He's usually here on Tuesday mornings. . .\n#Person1#: Today is Tuesday.\n#Person2#: I know. He's usually here, but today he went out to a site on the east side.\n#Person1#: That's too bad. I need to discuss these plans with him.\n#Person2#: Why don't you make an appointment for later in the week?\n#Person1#: Alright.\n#Person2#: He's here on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Fridays. What day did you want to see him?\n#Person1#: Friday is good.\n#Person2#: Morning or afternoon?\n#Person1#: Morning.\n#Person2#: I can put you down for ten o'clock. Is that alright?\n#Person1#: Yes. My name is Laura Wills.\n#Person2#: Alright. I have you down for ten AM this Friday.\n#Person1#: Thank you.\n#Person2#: You are welcome.
#Person1#: You'Ve been a sales manager for three years. How do you like the job?\n#Person2#: I like it very much.\n#Person1#: If I may ask, are you happy with your salary?\n#Person2#: No, I don't mind at all. I receive 3, 000 RMB a month, after tax.\n#Person1#: Is there a bonus system or any other incentive plan in place?\n#Person2#: I'm afraid there isn't. My boss only pays lip service.\n#Person1#: What is your salary expectation for this position?\n#Person2#: My expectation is in the 3800 to 4500 RMB range. That's the take-home pay.
#Person1#: Hello, excuse me!\n#Person2#: Hello! Is there anything I can help you with?\n#Person1#: Yes. I wanna know where I can get on the bus going downtown.\n#Person2#: Go straight then turn right, and you will see a big bus station there.\n#Person1#: Ok, I see. Thank you!\n#Person2#: You are welcome!
#Person1#: This is our rock - bottom price, Mr. Li. We can't make any further concessions.\n#Person2#: If that's the case, there's not much point in further discussion. We might as well call the whole deal off.\n#Person1#: What I mean is that we'll never be able to come down to your price. The gap is too great.\n#Person2#: I think it unwise for either of us to insist on his own price. How about meeting each other half way so that business can be concluded?\n#Person1#: What is your proposal?\n#Person2#: Your unit price is 100 dollars higher than we can accept. When I suggested we meet each other half way, I meant it literally.\n#Person1#: Do you mean to suggest that we have to make a further reduction of 50 dollars in our price? That's impossible.\n#Person2#: What would you suggest?\n#Person1#: The best we can do will be a reduction of another 30 dollars. That'll definitely be rock bottom.\n#Person2#: That still leaves a gap of 20 dollars to be covered. Let's meet each other half way once more, then the gap will be closed and our business completed.\n#Person1#: You certainly have a way of talking me into it. All right, let's meet half way again.\n#Person2#: I'm glad we've come to an agreement on price. We'll go on to the other terms and conditions at our next meeting.\n#Person1#: Yes, there's one other point I wish to clear up.\n#Person2#: What is it?\n#Person1#: My friends in business circles all seem to be of the opinion that the U. S. import and export corporations have become more flexible in doing business recently.\n#Person2#: Yes, they're right. In fact, we have either restored or adopted international practices in our foreign trade.\n#Person1#: I'm glad to hear that. With a view to expanding and further enhancing the bilateral relations between our two parties, and in particular, exchanging timely views on specific problems in the execution and enforcement of contracts, is it possible for us to have a representative that could stay permanently in Washing - ton D. C. ?\n#Person2#: Basically speaking, yes, we welcome the establishment of repry - tentative offices by foreign companies in Washington D. C. Of course, there are more details to be attended to. We cannot settle it in a few words.\n#Person1#: Yes, of course. I'll call my home office tonight and let them know about it. When do we meet again?\n#Person2#: How about tomorrow morning at 9?\n#Person1#: Good. I'll come back tomorrow, and we can then discuss it more specifically.
#Person1#: Kelly, the guys and I think you should run for senior class president.\n#Person2#: Me? Why me? Why not you?\n#Person1#: We talked to our older brothers and sisters last night and got the scoop on what that job is all about.\n#Person2#: And you think I fit the qualifications?\n#Person1#: Yes. Did you know that the senior class president works for the class for life? The job doesn't stop when we graduate.\n#Person2#: Really? What is there to do after we graduate?\n#Person1#: Every class reunion is organized by the president and council and anything our class does for the school in later years is headed by the president.\n#Person2#: I'm honored that you think I would be qualified. But I would really have to think about this first.
#Person1#: I really appreciate your filling me in on yesterday's lecture.\n#Person2#: No problem. I thought you might want to go over it together. And, anyway, it helps me review, Hope you're feeling better now.\n#Person1#: I am. Thanks. So, you said she talked about squid? Sounds a little strange.\n#Person2#: Well, actually, it was about the evolution of sea life--a continuation from last week. The octopus and the squid descended from earlier creatures with shells. They survived by shedding their shells--somewhere between 200 and 500 million years ago.\n#Person1#: That's a pretty long span of time.\n#Person2#: I know. That's what she said, though. To be precise: 'Exactly when they emerged is uncertain ... and why is still unexplained.'\n#Person1#: Some squid are really huge. Can you imagine something that big if it still had a shell?\n#Person2#: Actually, it's because they lost their shells that they could evolve to a bigger size.\n#Person1#: Makes sense. But some are really huge. I've read about fishermen that caught squid that weighed over a ton. Did she talk about how that happens?\n#Person2#: Not really. But she did mention some unusual cases. In 1933 in New Zealand they caught a squid.., let's see here.., it was twenty-two yards long. Its eyes were eighteen inches across. Can you imagine?\n#Person1#: Reminds me of all those stories of sea monsters.\n#Person2#: Dr. Simpson thinks there are probably even larger ones that haven't been found because squid are intelligent and fast---so they can easily get away from humans. Maybe some of those monster stories are true.
#Person1#: Solomon Department Store. May I help you?\n#Person2#: Yes, could you tell me when the store closes today?\n#Person1#: We close at 7:00.\n#Person2#: I see. And when do you open?\n#Person1#: Ten o'clock on the weekend.\n#Person2#: Fine. Thank you very much.
#Person1#: I want to see about getting a private room as soon as possible. Also please put a 'No Visitors' sign on my door.\n#Person2#: I'll take care of both things, but first put this in your mouth so that I can take your temperature.
#Person1#: Can you believe that we've finally found a house?\n#Person2#: Good for you. Tell me about the house!\n#Person1#: It doesn't look good outside. but it is lovely inside.\n#Person2#: How nice! How many bedrooms does it have?\n#Person1#: Well, it has three bedrooms, two bathrooms, one big sitting room and a modern kitchen.\n#Person2#: Then your two boys don't need to share a room. They are happy with it?\n#Person1#: Yeah, they can have their own rooms. What interests me most is the small garden before the house. You know I love gardening so much.
#Person1#: I've noticed that you spend a lot of time tending your garden. Would you like to join our gardening club? We meet every other Wednesday.\n#Person2#: Oh, thanks for the invitation, but this is how I relax. I'd rather not make it something formal and structured.
#Person1#: Hi! Weren't you two at the English Evening yesterday?\n#Person2#: Yes. How did you like it?\n#Person1#: I thought it was great! I'm Jeff. What are your names?\n#Person2#: I'm Allison and this is Melissa.\n#Person1#: Nice to meet both of you.
#Person1#: Excuse me. Uh, I want to get my girlfriend a sweater for her birthday, but I can't find the right one.\n#Person2#: Well, um, what about these over here?\n#Person1#: Uh, this one is okay. I like the style, but do you the same thing in a blue, a blue color?\n#Person2#: Um, well, Hmm. I don't ... I don't see a blue one, but about this green one?\n#Person1#: Uh, do you have the same thing in a dark green? And what size is this one anyway?\n#Person2#: It's a large.\n#Person1#: Oh, my girlfriend wears a small. That won't work.\n#Person2#: Well, what about this red one?\n#Person1#: Ummm, it's okay. How much is it? I don't see a price tag.\n#Person2#: Well, let's see. It usually sells for $34, but it's on sale for $16.\n#Person1#: Hmm. Okay, I'll take it. Thanks.
#Person1#: Great party, isn't it?\n#Person2#: Sure is. Jane and Ted always have great parties.\n#Person1#: This is my first. Jane and I teach at the same school.\n#Person2#: Oh, so you're a teacher?\n#Person1#: Yeah, history. What about you?\n#Person2#: I work for General Motors.\n#Person1#: What do you do there?\n#Person2#: I'm a manager's assistant.\n#Person1#: Oh, I see. By the way, my names's Bob Evans.\n#Person2#: Glad to meet you. I'm Jane Taylor.
#Person1#: I'm worried about Monday's exam.\n#Person2#: Take it easy. I'm sure you will do well if you take it easy and remain calm.\n#Person1#: Is it all right if I use dictionaries?\n#Person2#: You are not allowed to use them. I think.\n#Person1#: Do you think I could discuss the questions with others during the exam?\n#Person2#: I'm afraid that's impossible. Teachers would not allow that to happen.\n#Person1#: May I bring some paper to write drafts?\n#Person2#: Yes, that's all right, I suppose.\n#Person1#: Thank you very much for the information.
#Person1#: Are you feeling all right, Mary? You look a little tired.\n#Person2#: My brother and I had a birthday for my sister last night. So I didn't have much sleep.\n#Person1#: Where did you have the party?\n#Person2#: It was at my uncle's house.\n#Person1#: Did you go back home very late?\n#Person2#: Not really. But when I was home, I had to start typing a literature paper that was due first thing in the morning.\n#Person1#: Couldn't you do it today?\n#Person2#: No, our professor said she wouldn't accept any late papers.\n#Person1#: Then how did you manage it?\n#Person2#: Well, I just turned my paper in, and now I'm going home to bed. See you!
#Person1#: With us now, is Malcolm Bricklin, CEO of Visionary Vehicles.\n#Person2#: Hello, everyone.\n#Person1#: We have been hearing a couple of things about this news that Ford Motor Company is slashing up to 30,000 jobs, shutting down 14 plants nationwide. Is it a big deal if we are no longer manufacturing these cars, Malcolm?\n#Person2#: I think it's a huge deal. I mean the companies are massive employers both directly and indirectly. If you look at Ford after their restructuring, they've actually got 87,000 employees which is twice as many as Microsoft have worldwide. Moreover, if you look at those jobs, they are very high-paying jobs. These are people who can afford to buy their own products.\n#Person1#: Er, it seems to indicate a big hit for our economy if these jobs go bye-bye.\n#Person2#: Yeah, it's a really sad day for America.\n#Person1#: But it is not as if cars are stopped being made, right?\n#Person2#: Correct. Still a large number of cars are being made by American manufacturers. More than half of the American cars sold in America are American. So what has happened over time is that as the market share has fallen, foreign car companies have come in, taken over plants and set up new plants, and they have taken over that capacity. So, it is not like there are fewer cars being produced in America than there were 30 years ago.\n#Person1#: Let me ask you about the Chinese coming in. What would it mean to American jobs, if and when that happens?\n#Person2#: The Chinese cars we have seen so far aren't that great and they don't have the branding necessary to make a huge impact in the world stage.
#Person1#: Hi, Johanna! Are you interested in going to an Art Exhibition on Sunday? A friend of mine is showing some of her paintings there. It's the opening night. Free drinks and food!\n#Person2#: Well, actually, I don't have anything planned. It sounds kind of fun!
#Person1#: I've been thinking about joining a health club myself. My doctor has been encouraging me to get more exercise. Which club do you belong to?\n#Person2#: It's called the Good-life Health Club. I've only been going since Jan., but I've already noticed a big improvement. I feel like a new person.\n#Person1#: Really? What do you do there?\n#Person2#: They have a gym with exercise equipment and an indoor pool. I usually start by working out for about half an hour. Then I take a swim. After exercising, the water feels great.\n#Person1#: That sounds good. But aren't you afraid of over-working yourself?\n#Person2#: No, no. Everything is carefully controlled and supervised. If you're interested in seeing for yourself, I'm going again on Tuesday. Why don't you come along as my guest? You'll enjoy yourself.\n#Person1#: That's a good idea. Thanks. I just might.
#Person1#: It's too hot to read. \n#Person2#: We'd better go out for a walk. \n#Person1#: Which season do you like best? \n#Person2#: Spring. \n#Person1#: How about summer? \n#Person2#: I dislike it most. \n#Person1#: Why? \n#Person2#: Because the hottest season is summer in a year. \n#Person1#: But sometimes summer is more charming than the other seasons. 
#Person1#: Excuse me, I'm looking for the Alanis Morrissette album Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie. \n#Person2#: Let's see. If we have it, it should be over there under M. ( He looks through the CDs. ) Hmm, it looks like we've sold out of that one, but we should be getting some more copies in soon. If you want, we can order it for you. \n#Person1#: That's okay, I'll just check back later. Do you have the new Sting album? \n#Person2#: Yes, it's right over here. \n#Person1#: Great. One last question, where is your jazz section? \n#Person2#: Back there against that wall. \n#Person1#: Oh, I see it. Thanks for your help. \n#Person2#: No problem. 
#Person1#: are you ready to go the concert? \n#Person2#: yes. Shoud we go there by bus so we aren't late? \n#Person1#: actually, why don't we go there by bike? We could get stuck in traffic if we travel by bus in ruch hour. \n#Person2#: that's true. Cycling is good for our environment, too. Let me just get my helmet then. \n#Person1#: is your helmet comfortable? \n#Person2#: not really, but I liked the design, so I got it. \n#Person1#: maybe you shoud think about getting a round helmet; they're better. \n#Person2#: I'll think about it. \n#Person1#: is that your new bicycle? \n#Person2#: yes, my father gave it to me for my birthday. Do you like it? \n#Person1#: it's the newest 10 speed cycling mountain bike. These are really expensive! \n#Person2#: nothing but the best from my dad. I like everything about it except for the brakes. They are a bit sticky. \n#Person1#: I can fix those for you. Is there anything else wrong with it? \n#Person2#: well, my saddle is too low for me. Do you know how to change the height? \n#Person1#: that's easy. It's important to have the saddle high enough so that your legs can extend fully when you are on your bicycle. \n#Person2#: is that why my knees have felt sore after every time I've ridden my bike? \n#Person1#: it's possible. Give me a minute and I can fix these for you and then we can go. 
#Person1#: Mom, I just finished my paper. Can you proofread it before I hand it in? \n#Person2#: Sure, let's take a look. Sweetie, this is terrific. Your ideas are so original. \n#Person1#: Thanks. \n#Person2#: I can tell you worked hard on it. \n#Person1#: I really did! I started thinking about what I wanted to say three weeks ago. \n#Person2#: Well, it was definitely worth all the time. \n#Person1#: Let's just hope my teacher agrees. 
#Person1#: John, if you don't mind, I'd like to ask you a personal question. \n#Person2#: I don't mind at all. \n#Person1#: All right. Are you married? \n#Person2#: To tell you the truth, I'm not married. I'm still single. \n#Person1#: Then, when do you plan to get married? \n#Person2#: I don't know. It's still up in the air. 
#Person1#: Hey, Jenny. Would you like to go to dinner with me? \n#Person2#: I don't know. You know what they say about office romances. \n#Person1#: No, I don't. What do they say about office romances? \n#Person2#: They say you shouldn't mix love and work. \n#Person1#: That's silly. What I do on my own time is no one else's business. Besides, it's pretty hard to meet people outside of the office when we spend long hours here. \n#Person2#: You've got a point. Once I dated one of my supervisors and all of my co-workers accused him of favoritism. Then when the relationship went bad, he fired me. \n#Person1#: People fall in love with people they work with. That's a fact. \n#Person2#: That may be true, but I don't want an inter-office relationship to affect my productivity. \n#Person1#: If it does, it will only make you more productive, because we can support each other. \n#Person2#: You are sounding like we are already married. \n#Person1#: Good grief. All I did was ask you out. I am sorry. \n#Person2#: Well, I don't feel right about it. \n#Person1#: I am talking about dinner tonight, not a lifetime. \n#Person2#: Most starts with dinner, but then it gets out of hand. Besides, haven't you asked out every woman in the entire office? \n#Person1#: I like company. \n#Person2#: Company? I heard about you from Linda. She said you were an octopus! \n#Person1#: What can I say? I am a passionate guy. \n#Person2#: Well, I hope you can find something else to be passionate about. \n#Person1#: You want to go out with me and you know it. \n#Person2#: In your dreams. Now if you don't mind, I've got some work to do. \n#Person1#: Ok, I get the message. Hey, do you have any sisters? 
#Person1#: Hey, look at these paintings on the wall! Aren't they beautiful? Linda bought some good paintings. \n#Person2#: Yeah, very impressive. Oh, this one's marvelous! \n#Person3#: Sure, they're very colorful. \n#Person4#: Thank you. You are very generous with your compliments. \n#Person1#: You know the first thing most Chinese students would ask is how much did this painting cost? \n#Person2#: Right. I've noticed that too. They always ask that question before they say anything else. \n#Person3#: That's true. Most Chinese do that. I don't know why. It's just a habit. I've noticed that foreigners often make compliments soon after they see a product someone has bought - even if they don't really mean it. \n#Person1#: Yeah, we're just different. We can't figure out why many Chinese people don't give big hugs to their own parents after they grow up. \n#Person3#: No, we don't do that. At least very few people I know do that. \n#Person2#: And as far as I know, it's not common for a Chinese to say, I love you to anyone including his or her soul mate. \n#Person4#: Cindy, please don't misunderstand. We're not saying that one way is better than another. They're just different, that's all. 
#Person1#: Hi, there. I'm looking for a jacket for the fall. Do you have any suggestions?\n#Person2#: Sure, do you need something that you can wear in the rain or are you looking for something lighter?\n#Person1#: Well, it does rain a lot here. What is the difference between the 2?\n#Person2#: If you look at this black jacket here, you can see that it is made of heavier material. It has more pockets, too. This green one is much lighter.\n#Person1#: So, what if I want something that will protect me from the wind and the rain?\n#Person2#: Then you'll want a winter coat, like this red one.\n#Person1#: All right You can put the others back on the shelf.\n#Person2#: Great. You've made a wise decision, sir.
#Person1#: Mark, I remember last week you told me that you wanted to learn a foreign language. Here is an ad that you may be interested in. Jackson College language school. They have German, Russian and Spanish. Is there a language that you want to learn?\n#Person2#: Yes, the last one. I want to go to Spain and settle down there. Where do they offer the courses?\n#Person1#: Their classes are given in different places. You could go to their branch school called New Century. It's just 3 blocks away.\n#Person2#: That's really close. I can get there by bike.\n#Person1#: Yes, by the way, would you like to go with me to the History Museum this Thursday?\n#Person2#: I'd like to but I have to practice the piano in the morning and then I have an art class in the afternoon.
#Person1#: Your garden looks beautiful this summer, the flowers are really colorful.\n#Person2#: Thank you. I have roses, tulips and daffodils. Do you like the rockery with the small flowers?\n#Person1#: Yes, I do. Those are violets are they?\n#Person2#: Yes, they are. This afternoon I'm going to water these flowers.\n#Person1#: The lower branches on that tree are hanging very low. Would you like me to cut them off for you?\n#Person2#: Thank you. That would be very kind of you. I have a saw in the garden shed.\n#Person1#: When the lower branches are removed you'll be able to sit under the tree.\n#Person2#: Tomorrow, I'll cut the grass. Then the garden will look perfect.\n#Person1#: Just make sure children don't play in the flower beds and destroy the flowers.
#Person1#: What are you surfing, Jack?\n#Person2#: The parenting site parentdish come made a survey, a little funny.\n#Person1#: About what? The relationship between parents and children?\n#Person2#: No, to find the Top gift on Mother's Day.\n#Person1#: What if the result?\n#Person2#: Those choose time with my family are 63% over chocolates and Flowers.\n#Person1#: You smile because the way helps save money?
#Person1#: Excuse me Madam?\n#Person2#: What can I do for you?\n#Person1#: I'm a newcomer here. Can you tell me the way to the Renaissance Hotel?\n#Person2#: Sure. You first go along this Main Street until you come to a crossroad where you will see a shopping mall, then turn right at that Crossroad and continue until you see a Citibank, keep going past the bank until you see a coffee shop. The Renaissance Hotel is just around there.\n#Person1#: How long does it take to get there? I must get there before 11:00 o'clock. 30 minutes from now.\n#Person2#: Don't worry Sir, it's about a 20 minute walk.\n#Person1#: Thanks a lot.
#Person1#: What's all that screaming about?\n#Person2#: I just poured some ice water on Amy, while she was in the hot shower, you should have seen her face.\n#Person1#: You shouldn't tease your sister so much.\n#Person2#: Aaah it was just a joke mom.\n#Person1#: You take it too far sometimes Matt, if my brother had been like you when I was growing up, I would have gone crazy. Remember the time you replaced her toothpaste with hot pepper? And when you put salt in her cake, that was just before her tenth birthday.\n#Person2#: Sorry about that mom, that was a little too much. But Amy likes my jokes, she always laughs about it afterwards.\n#Person1#: She does have a good sense of humor. You are lucky she loves you so much. My brother and I weren't as close. He was 5 years older and if he teased me, I always felt hurt. It's good that you and Amy are only one year apart in age.\n#Person2#: She's my best friend, I like making her scared but I'll never hurt her.
#Person1#: Hello, uh I'm a first-time caller. My problem is that my father went away on a business trip and I borrowed his new car, but I had an accident. I was not hurt, but the car was broken.\n#Person2#: Where is your mother?\n#Person1#: She is away, visiting some friends.\n#Person2#: Alright, go on.\n#Person1#: Well, I told my father the car was lossed. Someone had stolen it.\n#Person2#: Oh, you should've told your father the truth. He would understand about a car accident and he would be glad you weren't hurt.\n#Person1#: I'm not too sure about that.\n#Person2#: Give it a try, young man, because the truth is always better than a lie.\n#Person1#: OK. I think you're right.
#Person1#: RU ru. Hey, can you get your dog to stop barking? Some people are trying to sleep around here.\n#Person2#: Now wait a minute. Princes just barking because your cat is screaming all over the place.\n#Person1#: But do you know what time it is? It's 1:00 AM and I've got to get up at 6:00 to go to work. If I don't get some sleep soon, they'll be 1 less dog in the world.\n#Person2#: Are you frightening my dog?\n#Person1#: I'm merely telling you the truth, barking at night is one of the leading causes of death in dogs.\n#Person2#: You're mad.\n#Person1#: That's possible. Get your dog to close his mouth.\n#Person2#: You ought to shut your own mouth.\n#Person1#: Berenice, get the poison.\n#Person2#: Now come here, Prince. Nice boy. I'm going to take you inside.
#Person1#: What are you doing, little Sarah?\n#Person2#: I am looking at my pictures. dad. I painted them in class.\n#Person1#: Show me your pictures, dear. Oh, what's that, Sarah?\n#Person2#: It's a house.\n#Person1#: And what are those?\n#Person2#: Those are rooms. This room is the kitchen. That's my bedroom.\n#Person1#: What are those green lines?\n#Person2#: They are not lines, dad. They are trees. These trees are in the blue sky.\n#Person1#: Is that a plane?\n#Person2#: It's not a plane, dad. It's you? You are in the sky!
#Person1#: I wonder why the Sunflower went out of business? It got a great review and dining magazine, and every time I ate there, there was a big crowd.\n#Person2#: It's not closed forever. There was a fire in the kitchen last month. But they planned to re-open as soon as the damage is repaired.\n#Person1#: I'm glad to hear that. It was one of the best spots in town. It was so clean, the workers were so friendly and the food was great.
#Person1#: Hey Lucy, I have a question I'd like to ask you.\n#Person2#: Yes, go ahead.\n#Person1#: Well, don't laugh. But I met this really nice woman through an online music group. I need some advice. You see, Claudia.\n#Person2#: Ok, so it's Claudia.\n#Person1#: Yeah yeah, she invited me to spend 2 weeks in Germany. She is planning on introducing me to her parents. What should you do when you greet someone for the first time in Germany?\n#Person2#: Well, it depends upon your relationship with the person. Now Speaking of your girlfriend Claudia.\n#Person1#: Hey, I didn't say she was my girlfriend.\n#Person2#: Oh, ok ok, now, if you're meeting someone for the first time, like Claudia's parents, you should make sure you arrive on time.\n#Person1#: Ok, so arrive on time. Uh, what about common greetings?\n#Person2#: Well, Germans often shake hands and they use the person's family name unless they're really close friends.\n#Person1#: Ok. What about with Claudia?\n#Person2#: Uh, you can call her Claudia, shake hands and why don't you take her some flowers?
#Person1#: Good afternoon. May I help you, sir?\n#Person2#: Could you please change this note for me?\n#Person1#: Don't you want to buy anything in my shop?\n#Person2#: Sorry, I just need some change. I have got to phone someone.\n#Person1#: OK. Let me see if I can help you.\n#Person2#: That's very kind of you.\n#Person1#: I'm sorry I'm rather short of change myself, but there is a bank across the road you can get some there.\n#Person2#: Well, thank you all the same.
#Person1#: Can I help you?\n#Person2#: I'm looking for someone who works here, but I lost his business card. His name's Long or Sang or something like that.\n#Person1#: Chang?\n#Person2#: Yeah, that sounds right.\n#Person1#: There are about twenty people named Chang who work here. What department?\n#Person2#: Let me think... accounting, finance, something like that.\n#Person1#: Eric Chang in accounting?\n#Person2#: That's him!\n#Person1#: I'll call him and tell him you're here.\n#Person2#: I appreciate your help.\n#Person1#: Would you like to have a seat over there? It'll just be a minute. And can I have your name?\n#Person2#: Here's my card.\n#Person1#: OK. I'll have him come up to get you.
#Person1#: Excuse me, I need to get to Cambridge today.\n#Person2#: Would you like to go by train or by bus?\n#Person1#: I am not sure, which one is better?\n#Person2#: The bus is cheaper but also slower. It will take about two-and-a-half hours.\n#Person1#: And how long does the train take?\n#Person2#: If you take the fast train, it will take about 50 minutes.\n#Person1#: Where do I catch the train?\n#Person2#: The trains for Cambridge leave from King's Cross Station. They run approximately every half hour. Most trains to Cambridge go from Platform 9.\n#Person1#: How do I get to King's Cross?\n#Person2#: The best way is to take an underground tube train directly to King's Cross. The Underground station is just round the corner from here.\n#Person1#: Can you show me on the map?\n#Person2#: It is very easy. Just turn right when you leave and then turn right again at the first crossroads. The entrance to the Underground station is about 50 meters further on.\n#Person1#: Thank you very much.\n#Person2#: You're welcome.

#Person1#: Are you interested in mountaineering?\n#Person2#: Yes, in some sense. I should say I like mountain climbing, you know, because I'm not so professional. How about you\n#Person1#: I'm the same with you, an amateur mountain climber. I went climbing in the Rocky Mountains with my friends last summer vacation. We spent two days in the mountains.\n#Person2#: How did you spend the night there?\n#Person1#: We pitched a tent in the night, waiting for the sunrise. Wow! It was too beautiful.\n#Person2#: I had a similar experience, but that was on the top of Tasha Mountain in my country.\n#Person1#: Tasha Mountain? It's very famous in China, isn't?\n#Person2#: Yes. It is one of the Five Mountains.\n#Person1#: I want to climb Tasha Mountain this summer vacation. Would you be my guide?\n#Person2#: I'd love to.

We are looking forward to seeing you.

#Person1#: Are you going to helen's birthday party on Friday evening?\n#Person2#: I wouldn't miss it for the world! It's sure to be fun. She's invited a lot of people. Do you think everyone will be able to get into her house?\n#Person1#: If everyone turned up, it would be a squeeze. But a few people said that they couldn't go.

She told me that she had bought plenty of food and snacks. I think it's going to be a noisy party. I hope her neighbors don't mind too much.\n#Person1#: Helen gets on very well with her neighbors. I wouldn't be surprised if they went to the party too.\n#Person2#: I'm really looking forward to it. This party is going to be a blast!\n#Person1#: Well, don't be late.

You should know how to use them.\n#Person2#: Should we remember all the new words and expressions?\n#Person1#: Certainly.\n#Person2#: Sorry, I don't quite understand some difficult points in this unit.

Thank you very much.\n#Person1#: My pleasure Miss. Actually, could you recommend what to eat here? I've never been here before.\n#Person2#: Sure. Well, the avocado sandwich is delicious, and it's the healthiest thing on the menu. Personally, I think the beef salad is the tastiest choice. I usually get that. Also, the milkshakes are the best milkshakes in town!\n#Person1#: Well, thanks for the suggestions.\n#Person2#: Oh, don't mention it.
#Person1#: Are there many idioms in English?\n#Person2#: There are hundreds and hundreds. English is particularly rich in idiomatic expressions.\n#Person1#: Can you give us an example?\n#Person2#: I'll look up the rate. To look up doesn't mean to look high into the sky or to look at the roof. It means to search for and find some information.\n#Person1#: What about the expression ' goodbye '? Is that an idiom?\n#Person2#: That is just a natural, grammatical English expression. It has a direct translation in other languages.\n#Person1#: This is interesting, Ms. Parker.
#Person1#: Any plans tonight?\n#Person2#: Not really, do you?\n#Person1#: Well, I am wondering if we took a hang-out for a drink or something. You know, I just came back from a really tough interview. I was quite nervous during the interview. I really want to have the job. Right now, I am still a little on the edge. I am not sure if I could convince them during the interview.\n#Person2#: Take it easy. It is all over now. How was it going, anyway?\n#Person1#: I don't know. I think I did well in the paper exams. I was prepared to answer a lot of questions, but they didn't ask those as I expected. To my surprise, the manager tried to talk about the Chinese poesy with me.\n#Person2#: That's strange. But probably, it is the new interview technique they call it ' Getting to know you more personally '. What about your answers?\n#Person1#: Just did my best.

#Person1#: Have you seen the news that there is a serious flood in the South?\n#Person2#: Yes. I've got to cancel my traveling plan.\n#Person1#: What a pity! I know you've been longing for it these months.\n#Person2#: The only thing I can do now is waiting for another chance.
#Person1#: Did you make it to school today?\n#Person2#: I always do. Did you go to school today?\n#Person1#: No, I didn't.\n#Person2#: You should have, but have you seen any movies lately?\n#Person1#: That was an odd change of subject.\n#Person2#: Maybe it was, but answer the question.\n#Person1#: No, not recently.\n#Person2#: I want to go to see a movie this weekend.\n#Person1#: What's stopping you then?\n#Person2#: I don't want to go alone.\n#Person1#: So, will you be at school tomorrow?\n#Person2#: No, I want to go to the movies instead.
#Person1#: Could I speak to the apartment manager?\n#Person2#: I am the apartment manager. How can I help you?\n#Person1#: I wanted to know if that apartment on Main Street is still for rent.\n#Person2#: I haven't rented it out yet. Would you like to see it?\n#Person1#: Yes, I want to see it.\n#Person2#: How about today at 6 p. m. ?\n#Person1#: That time is okay with me.\n#Person2#: Very good. We'll meet at 6. Do you need directions?\n#Person1#: No, thank you. I go by there on my way to work.\n#Person2#: If you're interested, you can fill out an application form.\n#Person1#: That's a good idea. Do I need to bring anything myself?\n#Person2#: No. The only thing I need to see is your driver's license.
#Person1#: How's your new job going?\n#Person2#: Really well, thanks.\n#Person1#: How are you finding your new boss?\n#Person2#: She's not bad. She's a bit bossy, but I'm sure I'll get used to her.\n#Person1#: Would you rather have her or your old boss back?\n#Person2#: She's far better than my old boss. He didn't know how to express his opinion without putting at least one other person down.\n#Person1#: How about your new co-workers?\n#Person2#: They are all pretty easy-going. It's a very friendly place to work.\n#Person1#: Do you miss your old co-workers?\n#Person2#: Of course. I spent so much time at my old workplace that I got to know them all very well. They were like family to me.\n#Person1#: Do people in different departments get along with each other?\n#Person2#: Sure. Since we work together in teams, we have to get along with each other.\n#Person1#: Do you like working in teams with people from different departments?\n#Person2#: Yes, it helps everyone to understand what we're doing from different perspectives.\n#Person1#: Do you like working in teams?\n#Person2#: I prefer it to working independently. I think most people do.

So you are loaving on Duty 21st and your seat is in the business section.\n#Person2#: That's right. Thank you.
#Person1#: Today more and more people advocate lifelong learning. But people have different views about lifelong learning. How do you understand lifelong learning?\n#Person2#: I think lifelong learning is the concept that it's never too soon or too late for learning\n#Person1#: Does that mean studying all the time?\n#Person2#: I don't think so. I think it's about your attitude towards learning. One should be open to new ideas, decisions, skills or behaviors.\n#Person1#: Then the axiom -'You can't teach an old dog new tricks'doesn't work any longer.\n#Person2#: You're right. Lifelong learning is about finding learning opportunities at all ages and in numerous contexts\n#Person1#: Yes, I agree with you. When I retired I will participate in programs to keep momentally active.\n#Person2#: Me too. To keep up with the changing world, one must be involved in lifelong learning and be ready to accept new things.\n#Person1#: You know what? I've recently been teaching myself French.\n#Person2#: Really? That's great! I know that your company has a lot of clients in France.\n#Person1#: Yes, so I want to learn French to develop my career.

Taxis and I get along just fine.\n#Person2#: No private vehicle, no limo. Got it. Where are you going?\n#Person1#: I'm seeing a show at Rockefeller Center.\n#Person2#: What time should the taxi be here to pick you up?\n#Person1#: I'm ready to go right now.\n#Person2#: I'll have a taxi for you momentarily, sir.\n#Person1#: Great! As soon as I brush my teeth, I'll be downstairs.\n#Person2#: You'll enjoy our new, clean taxis, sir.

#Person1#: how is your house hunting going?\n#Person2#: not very well. I haven't found anything within my price range yet.\n#Person1#: how much are you looking to spend?\n#Person2#: I can only afford about 300 pounds a month.\n#Person1#: looks like you're not going to get more than a bedroom in a shared flat with that.\n#Person2#: really? That's a lot of money to pay for one room.\n#Person1#: well, if you want to live in London, you have to pay the price!\n#Person2#: do you know of anyone who needs a roommate?\n#Person1#: I can ask around at work. Do you have a preference for makers or non-smokers?\n#Person2#: I'd prefer non-smoking roommates, but I guess I'll have to take what I can get!\n#Person1#: how long do you want to sign a contract for?\n#Person2#: I can sign a contract up to a year. I don't know where I'll be after that.\n#Person1#: do you need a furnished or unfurnished apartment?\n#Person2#: I don't have any furniture, so it'd be great if it were furnished.\n#Person1#: you know that you'll have to pay utilities on top of the rent, right?\n#Person2#: no, I thought that would be included in the rent.\n#Person1#: it's not usually included, so you'll have to factor in about 100 pounds more each month for utilities.\n#Person2#: I don't think I can afford that.\n#Person1#: don't worry. Sometimes people will give you a discount if you promise to do the clearing or take care of the children.\n#Person2#: that's a good idea. I'll look into finding something like that.

#Person1#: My wife and I are thinking about taking our parents with us on a vacation. Do you have any suggestion about where to go?\n#Person2#: The choice of destination is very important. It will too energetic for the old people if you make an excursion or go to climb mountains. But they'll be interested in going to the historical places of interest where they can have fun.\n#Person1#: Sometimes what young people like is different from the old. Maybe we can go visit first and then do some shopping.\n#Person2#: That's a good idea. That will allow both you and your parents to enjoy yourselves.\n#Person1#: What should we bring besides a change of clothes, money and some snacks?\n#Person2#: It's some medicine the doctor recommends. If you leave it at home, you will find it difficult to face up when the old people suffered a seizure.\n#Person1#: Oh, yes! I didn't think about that. Thank you for reminding me. How many days should we spend on a vacation?\n#Person2#: You'd better have all a light schedule. You can rest up for a few days if your parents find tired .\n#Person1#: It seems that good planning for a family vacation is important to make sure everyone will be happy.\n#Person2#: Yes, that's right. Having an enjoyable time together is the goal.
#Person1#: Did you hear who won the election?\n#Person2#: I can't believe that Obama won.\n#Person1#: I couldn't be happier to know that he's our new President.\n#Person2#: I know! He just made history!\n#Person1#: You voted for him, right?\n#Person2#: I did.

#Person1#: Oh, dear!\n#Person2#: I'm sorry. I do hope I haven't hurt you.\n#Person1#: Oh, no. I was just a little startled. That's all right. It's quite all right.\n#Person2#: But it isn't all right. I made you drop your shopping bags. Let me pick these bags up.\n#Person1#: You must have been in a great hurry. Never mind.\n#Person2#: I was only going to catch the bus. I'm afraid I wasn't looking where I was going. I hope nothing was destroyed.\n#Person1#: Oh, no. Thank you very much.\n#Person2#: I do apologize.\n#Person1#: Don't worry about it. There is no need to apologize. Look! Here comes the bus. You'll catch it if you run.\n#Person2#: Oh, so I shall.
#Person1#: Well, we'll certainly stay here again next time we're passing through.\n#Person2#: Good. Do let us know in advance and we'll try to get you the same room.\n#Person1#: That would be lovely. It may be quite soon in fact.\n#Person2#: Oh? How is that?\n#Person1#: Well. We are driving to the South of Spain in the next couple of days and we may come back this way.\n#Person2#: Do give us a ring if you decide to. I hope you'll have a pleasant trip.
#Person1#: Well, what do you think is the reason most people do so badly at reaching goals?\n#Person2#: They lose focus. Everybody's life is busy. There is so much happening in everybody's life. That what happens is they might have a goal and then something will get in the way of that. Maybe their goal is that they want to go on a holiday every year and they put in their leave form with their boss and their boss may ask them to wait for another month and then for another month. That is, so different things get in their way and people don't stand up for their goals. They don't struggle for them. They let other forces push them around a little bit. Also, a lot of people don't set goals; they think they do. But it's either a dream of very loose goal. So when they have to make a decision about a necessary action in their life the goal is so far back in their mind that they don't act in its best interest. Also because people will sit down and say 'oh, here are my goals' and forget all about them. Revisiting them every week is a good way. They stay at the top of your mind so you can take actions based on them.
#Person1#: Hi, Betty. How are things going with you?\n#Person2#: Not bad. I need a summer job.\n#Person1#: I was reading the wanted ads. Here's something for you. Wanted: Waitress for a new restaurant.\n#Person2#: Thank you. I'll have a try.
#Person1#: Are you doing anything special tonight?\n#Person2#: I have nothing tonight. Anything I can do for you?\n#Person1#: How about going to the movies? It will do you good to get your mind off your work for a while.\n#Person2#: That sounds like a good idea. But what is playing?\n#Person1#: I've looked up the entertainment section in the newspaper. There are some new films on in town.\n#Person2#: Is there anything interesting on?\n#Person1#: There is also a new Beijing Opera put on for the first time. I wonder if you are interested.\n#Person2#: Why not, of course.\n#Person1#: I do not think we have time to go back to the hotel if we want to watch the opera. Let's get something in a nearby restaurant.\n#Person2#: OK.
#Person1#: Hello? \n#Person2#: Hi Steve. This is Mike. What are you doing? \n#Person1#: Oh, hi. I was just watching TV. \n#Person2#: There's nothing to watch right now. \n#Person1#: I know. I was watching a re-run. I have nothing to do and I was bored. \n#Person2#: Me too. Let's get together and do something. \n#Person1#: I'd like to, but I have to meet my parents in an hour for dinner. How about tomorrow? \n#Person2#: Yeah. Let's plan something tomorrow. \n#Person1#: Did you hear the weather forecast for tomorrow? \n#Person2#: I think it is going to be the same as today. Clear and sunny. \n#Person1#: That's great. We can do something outdoors then. \n#Person2#: Are there any special events going on tomorrow? \n#Person1#: Yeah. I think there's a live outdoor concert by the river tomorrow. \n#Person2#: Oh yeah. I heard about that too. Let's go check it out. \n#Person1#: Do you know what time it starts? \n#Person2#: It starts at one PM. \n#Person1#: Let's meet for lunch at eleven thirty and afterwards, we can head over there. \n#Person2#: Perfect. I'll see you in front of the apartment at eleven thirty. 
#Person1#: Hi, could you help me find a place where I could buy some lunch? \n#Person2#: Sure! What kind of food would you like? \n#Person1#: I was thinking of pizza or something else Italian, maybe. \n#Person2#: I know the perfect place! \n#Person1#: Good! Where is it? \n#Person2#: It's right past that last building on the left. Do you want me to go with you? \n#Person1#: That would be great. \n#Person2#: Glad you asked me to join you. This will be fun! 
#Person1#: Did you meet the new girl in our sales department. She is taking the place of Maggie during her maternative leave. \n#Person2#: Did they finally fill that post, how come I haven't seen her? She must have not been inducted yet. \n#Person1#: I guess not, They haven't officially introduced her to the whole staff yet, she barely started yesterday. \n#Person2#: Is she just working temporarily? What are they going to do when Maggie comes back from leave. \n#Person1#: If the new girl is competent, maybe they will promote her when that time comes. 
#Person1#: Did you hear something? \n#Person2#: Oh, it is my cell phone ringing. I set it in the vibration mode. \n#Person1#: It is a good habit to set your cell phone to vibrate. It is very annoying to hear the loud and sudden ring tone in quiet offices. \n#Person2#: You are right. Some ring tone is just terribly loud. You can hear it even in the next door. It is really a kind of distraction. \n#Person1#: Maybe we can write a report to the boss to see what can be done. \n#Person2#: Good idea. 
#Person1#: Hi, Kerry. Do you follow the news every day?\n#Person2#: Sometimes.\n#Person1#: How do you follow the news?\n#Person2#: Well, here in Japan, mostly on the radio or the internet.\n#Person1#: Oh, really? OK. What radio station?\n#Person2#: NPR. But on the military station.\n#Person1#: OK, and what Internet websites do you listen to?\n#Person2#: Well, usually it is just AP news, BBC News or whatever.\n#Person1#: OK. How much of the news do you think is true?\n#Person2#: I don't know. That's a tough question, because there's so many journalists. The stories made into the papers tend to be accurate, but Unfortunately some people leak information that is untrue to influence public opinion. So you have to consider why that news story is made public.\n#Person1#: Yeah, how do most people in the states get news?\n#Person2#: I think most people in the states get news from TV and from the main broadcasting stations. The Evening News, sort of thing.\n#Person1#: OK, thanks Kerry.
#Person1#: OK, Neil. I am a student journalist from senior grade. I know you just came to this new school a few months ago. Can I interview you for the school newspaper?\n#Person2#: OK, I'm ready.\n#Person1#: Neil, how do you usually get to school in the morning?\n#Person2#: I usually go to school with my friends. We live very close to the school, so we don't have to take the bus. But on Fridays, my mother drives me to school.\n#Person1#: Good answer. What are your favorite subjects?\n#Person2#: I really enjoy physical education class. I love to go outside play games and have fun. I like English, too. But some of the words are hard to read and the grammar is hard too. Science is the most difficult for me.\n#Person1#: That's OK, you're doing well. One last question. How do you feel about going to school in America?\n#Person2#: I like it here. At first, I was scared but I like my friends and my teachers. I hope that one day I can speak English fluently.\n#Person1#: Well, I believe you will. Keep up the good work, Neil.
#Person1#: This is a wonderful pie. Is it homemade?\n#Person2#: It is, but I didn't make it. Jack did.\n#Person1#: I didn't know your husband cooked.\n#Person2#: Every week he makes something wonderful. He makes great fresh bread. Sometimes we give some to our neighbors.\n#Person1#: What else does your amazing husband do?\n#Person2#: He makes dinner every night.\n#Person1#: Really? I don't even know how to fry an egg.\n#Person2#: Jack even does the washing. I spend longer hours traveling from my home to my office and spend fewer hours at home. So he doesn't mind.\n#Person1#: Yes, our company is a little far from your home. Who does the cleaning?\n#Person2#: We both do. That way it only takes a small part of Saturday.
#Person1#: Have you seen the new show that everyone's talking about?\n#Person2#: It's called stranger things, I watched it this weekend and it was so cool.\n#Person1#: I haven't seen it yet, but yeah, everyone is talking about it, what's it about?\n#Person2#: Well, it's sort of a science fiction tale about a boy who gets caught in the upside down. The opposite world of ours. There are monsters and spiders action and even comedy. The coolest part is that most of the actors are kids our age, you should check it out.
#Person1#: What happened? I've been waiting for 2 hours.\n#Person2#: Sorry, we landed on time, but I couldn't exit the airplane with everyone else.\n#Person1#: Why not?\n#Person2#: Security stopped me. Just before we landed, a little girl dropped her backpack in my seat when I went to brush my teeth. I guess the flight attendant couldn't figure out whose it was and called security.\n#Person1#: So you landed at 7:00 and you've been with the police this whole time?\n#Person2#: Well, they let me go after an hour and a half, but I had to get my luggage. Oh, and there was no food on the flight either.\n#Person1#: You must be starving! Can I take you to a restaurant?\n#Person2#: Thanks.
#Person1#: Hello, can I get a taxi? We're just outside the city limits.\n#Person2#: No problem, ma'am, where exactly are you going? There is an extra charge for anything over 20 kilometers.\n#Person1#: The Roxy Club downtown, there are 6 of us, though. Do you have any bigger cars so we don't need to take two taxis?\n#Person2#: Yes, on the weekends, we do. However, it's $3 more to have the bigger car sent you away.\n#Person1#: That will be fine, and we should be well under the 20 kilometers to our destination.\n#Person2#: Yes, I can see that, would you like us to send that for you now?\n#Person1#: Yes, please.
#Person1#: I've received your letter of application and I see your current job is as a sales assistant at Ray Stones book shop? Why have you applied for this position?\n#Person2#: Well, I've really enjoyed my work at Ray Stones. I've always been interested in books and usually the customers are really nice. And I like trying to find books for them.\n#Person1#: So why do you want to leave?\n#Person2#: Because it's quite a small independent book shop. But EI books is a much bigger company. I read on your website. You have over 50 branches now and you're still growing, and I see you also have a website where people can order books.\n#Person1#: Well, it's true that we've grown quickly in recent years and it's nice to see you found out about the company. So would you describe yourself as ambitious?\n#Person2#: Um... I don't think so, but I'd like to be successful.\n#Person1#: And what are some of your main strengths?\n#Person2#: Ah, I work hard and I enjoy working with other people and uh, I can solve problems. You can always put your trust in me.\n#Person1#: That's good.
#Person1#: Nowadays fewer and fewer people go to the movie theaters to see films. So I am afraid that the film studios are really getting hard time to survive.\n#Person2#: What you said is true. But the film producers there are more flexible ways to get more audience. For example, to make more movie Ccds, so people will spend money buying them.\n#Person1#: But it is true that cinemas are losing the attraction they used to have in the past.\n#Person2#: Yes. Take myself for example. I seldom go to cinemas, but it doesn't mean I no longer see films ; instead, I see films at home-watching Ccds.
#Person1#: Do you believe in god?\n#Person2#: Not at all. I ' m an agnostic. do you?\n#Person1#: I ' m not sure. Why don ' t you believe there is a god?\n#Person2#: I think everything has a scientific explanation rather than a theological one.\n#Person1#: I basically believe in science over theology. I mean, I believe in evolution for example. However, there are many things that science hasn ' t explained yet.\n#Person2#: I ' m sure that science will explain everything eventually. I think that the strangest thing about religion is that so many religions people act in ways that their religion claims are wrong.\n#Person1#: For example?\n#Person2#: Religions preach tolerance, but many wars are caused by intolerant religious fanatics.\n#Person1#: Yes. Such people don ' t appear to be acting in accordance with their religious beliefs.
#Person1#: Good coming, sir. What can I do for you?\n#Person2#: Good coming. I would like to open a new account. I want to deposit 500 dollars.\n#Person1#: Very good, sir. What kind would you like?\n#Person2#: Could you tell me how many kinds there are in your bank?\n#Person1#: Besides the checking account, there's a monthly savings account and a daily interest account.\n#Person2#: Oh, I think I'd like to take the monthly savings account then.\n#Person1#: Would you fill out this form?\n#Person2#: OK. Here you are.\n#Person1#: All right. And here's your deposit book.\n#Person2#: Thank you. Goodbye.\n#Person1#: Goodbye.
#Person1#: OK, guys. Here's the plan. Get the ball to the goal, and keep it away from Rich and Taylor!\n#Person2#: Why? Are they good?\n#Person1#: They played ball at school. Here we go. Yi-jun, go out for a pass!\n#Person2#: I'm ready! Whoa, what a hard throw! I can't get that!\n#Person1#: Catch it, Yi-jun! Run to the ball! Uh-oh! Slow down, you're going to hit. . .\n#Person2#: Ummmph!

Please write them down on the notice board. I want everybody to see them.\n#Person2#: OK.
#Person1#: Did you read this? It says that the number one new years resolution make is to spend more time with friends and family.\n#Person2#: Why would that be funny?\n#Person1#: Well, think about it. We are a society that is always on the go, not because we have to, but because we want to.\n#Person2#: Why?\n#Person1#: We work hard and spend less time at home because we are trying to provide for our family with goods and services that are usually unnecessary.\n#Person2#: I don't agree, but anyways, I think you should start thinking of a new year's resolution yourself.\n#Person1#: What's the point? We always make a new year's resolution and by February we will have forgotten about it. It's pointless.\n#Person2#: Well then maybe you should resolve to sticking to your goals and objectives.\n#Person1#: What about you? Your gym bag is gathering dust and you still have brand new running shoes that are yet to be jogged in.\n#Person2#: Well, I would go if you kept your promise of going to the gym with me everyday!\n#Person1#: Yeah, yeah, whatever.
#Person1#: I just had a terrible week.\n#Person2#: What a shame!\n#Person1#: I fell down and hurt my arm.\n#Person2#: That's too bad.\n#Person1#: Then my son drove into a tree.\n#Person2#: I'm sorry to hear that.\n#Person1#: The dog bit the delivery boy.\n#Person2#: What a pity!\n#Person1#: And a storm blew our roof away.\n#Person2#: Ho, no!
#Person1#: Hey, Rose, how are you feeling?\n#Person2#: Much better today.\n#Person1#: Oh, Look at the baby. It's so beautiful. Is it a boy or a girl?\n#Person2#: It's a girl.\n#Person1#: Can I hold it for a moment?\n#Person2#: Sure. She is a peaceful child.\n#Person1#: Oh, how adorable! She's got your eyes.\n#Person2#: So they say.\n#Person1#: When are you returning home?\n#Person2#: Well. The doctor said I have to remain here for at least two more days because I'm rather weak after childbirth.\n#Person1#: You can use some time off. You'Ve been working too hard anyway.
#Person1#: The final examination will be held at the end of this month. Have you made good preparation?\n#Person2#: Sure. I've reviewed all the lessons I have learned this academic year.\n#Person1#: Are you sure you can do well this year?\n#Person2#: I am 100 % certain.\n#Person1#: According to what you did last time, I have my doubts.\n#Person2#: I am sure I can get a 95 this time.
#Person1#: I can't decide whether to go to university or to get a job.\n#Person2#: Well, if I were you, I'd go on studying.\n#Person1#: But I don't even know what to study.\n#Person2#: If I had chance again, I'd major in English. You're good at language.\n#Person1#: That's what my parents want me to do.\n#Person2#: You should take their advice. They know what's best for you. But my friends will have jobs and lots of fun, while I spend all my time doing reading and writing.\n#Person1#: But if you go to university, you'll still have time for fun.\n#Person2#: Hm, what you say makes sense. But you know, I still have to ask my parents for pocket money, and I hate to do so at this age.\n#Person1#: And if you try to find a part-time job, you'll have some money too.\n#Person2#: You're right. Thank you for the advice.
#Person1#: Can you help me set up my voicemail message? I just got this service and I am not really sure what I am supposed to say.\n#Person2#: Sure! You just basically gotta let the caller know who they called, and ask them for their contact information so you can call them back.\n#Person1#: Ok, so can I say, ' This is Abby's voicemail. I will call you later, so leave me your name and number '.\n#Person2#: That's more or less the idea, but try something that sounds more friendly.\n#Person1#: Ok, so how about this, ' This is Abby and I am really happy you called! I promise I will give you a ring as soon as I can, so please leave me your name and number. Talk to you soon! '.\n#Person2#: A little too friendly Abby. Just say this, ' Hi, you have reached Abby. I am unable to answer your call right now, but if you leave me your name and phone number, I will get back to you as soon as possible. Thanks '.\n#Person1#: That's perfect! Can you say that again and record it for me?
#Person1#: Tell me something about your work experience.\n#Person2#: Well, I have been in the computer engineering field for 6 years now. I am familiar with both hardware and software and with hands-on experience in system development including system analysis and design.\n#Person1#: What systems have you worked on?\n#Person2#: I have worked on about every system that is out right now.\n#Person1#: Do you feel comfortable with the new system by microcosm?\n#Person2#: I am not as familiar with it as I am with some of the older systems. But I am a fast learner and I can master it in a short time.\n#Person1#: What do you consider your strengths?\n#Person2#: I am knowledgeable and levelheaded.

#Person1#: Good morning, Sir.\n#Person2#: Morning.\n#Person1#: Is this where I catch the bus for the zoo?\n#Person2#: Yes. You can take No. 846 from here, but you have to get off at Nanchengmen stop and change to No. 106.\n#Person1#: That's a little troublesome.\n#Person2#: Actually, if you go to the bus stop in the next block, you can take No. 105 which will let you right off in front of the zoo gate.\n#Person1#: Maybe that's what I'll do. Thanks a lot.\n#Person2#: You're welcome.

Will you?\n#Person1#: I already have.\n#Person2#: How did you do that?\n#Person1#: I mailed in an absentee ballot.\n#Person2#: Why is that?\n#Person1#: I can't vote on Tuesday.\n#Person2#: What's the reason for that?\n#Person1#: I have to go to work.\n#Person2#: You can just go to work after you vote.\n#Person1#: I need to take care of some business that morning.\n#Person2#: I get it now.

It's in lieu of a deposit. If everything is OK when you check out, we give it back to you then. It's pretty sta\n#Person2#: I see.

#Person1#: how do you feel about wearing name logos or slogans on your clothing?\n#Person2#: I've never really thought about it before. I guess it doesn't bother me.\n#Person1#: do you think advertising has an influence on the choices you make when you're shopping?\n#Person2#: I guess so. I usually buy name-brand clothing, shoes, and electronic goods. How about you?\n#Person1#: I actually try to avoid name-brand items. I can't stand it when big companies advertise their products all over the place!
#Person1#: I must point out that trials of new medicine are expensive and you can never guarantee success.\n#Person2#: But there is a very good chance in this case. I hope you will go ahead in view of the potential benefit to mankind.
#Person1#: Hello, this is Andrea.\n#Person2#: Hello, Andrea, this is Alex. I have some very good news for you. Miranda was very satisfied with you and said she's very much looking forward to working with you. Isn't that wonderful? Congratulations dear! How does it feel to be Miranda's new assistant? I imagine that you'll just be delighted with this news. So let's see, you can start on Monday, right?\n#Person1#: Umm, well, I don't think I can start Monday. I am visiting my father in Baltimore. And because I don't live in New York, I'll need a couple of days to find a flat and buy some furniture and move my things from Avon.\n#Person2#: Oh, well then, in that case I suppose Wednesday would be good. Ok, see you then!
#Person1#: So that's the plan. Now may I ask your opinion about it, Mr. Grey?\n#Person2#: Well, in my view, the plan is not very good. But it can get the company moving again.\n#Person1#: Er... There might be sonic strong points there, but they may not be easily carried out.
#Person1#: Excuse me. Could I ask you some questions?\n#Person2#: Of course.\n#Person1#: I work for an advertising agency and I'm doing some research. It's for a new magazine for people like you.\n#Person2#: People like me? What do you mean?\n#Person1#: People between 25 and 35 years old.\n#Person2#: Ok.\n#Person1#: Right. Urn, what do you do at the weekend?\n#Person2#: Well, on Fridays, my wife always goes to her exercise class. Then, she visits friends.\n#Person1#: Don't you go out?\n#Person2#: Not on Fridays. I never go out on Fridays. I stay at home and watch television.\n#Person1#: And on Saturdays?\n#Person2#: On Saturdays my wife and I always go sailing together.\n#Person1#: Really?\n#Person2#: Mm, we love it. We never miss it. And then, in the evening, we go out.\n#Person1#: Where to?\n#Person2#: Different places. We sometimes go and see friends. We sometimes go to the cinema or restaurants. But we always go out on Saturday evenings.\n#Person1#: I see. And now Sunday. What happens on Sundays?\n#Person2#: Nothing special. We often go for a walk. And I always cook a big Sunday lunch.\n#Person1#: Oh. How often do you do the cooking?\n#Person2#: Urn, twice a week.., three times a week...\n#Person1#: Thank you very much. All I need now are your personal details, your name, job and so on. What's your surname?\n#Person2#: Robinson.
#Person1#: Dr. Brook, I just don't know what's wrong me. I always feel tired and weak. My wife finally persuaded me to visit you to find out what the trouble is.\n#Person2#: From what is written here I can see that you had a very bad cold three years ago and that you also had a small operation last year. Did you have any bad effect after that?\n#Person1#: Well, I don't remember.\n#Person2#: For example, how long did you stay at home each time you were ill?\n#Person1#: Just a couple of days, but about six months ago I was home for about two weeks with a cold or something.\n#Person2#: Did you see a doctor at that time, or did you just stay at home?\n#Person1#: No, I didn't see a doctor. When I began to feel better, I returned to work.\n#Person2#: And when did you start feeling so tired again?\n#Person1#: It must have been about ten days ago. When I came home from work one night, there just didn't seem to be any reason to go back the next day.\n#Person2#: Well, it sounds as if your problem may be the kind of work you do. The tests I just made don't show anything really wrong. But I would like to make some further tests in the hospital.\n#Person1#: That's fine with me.\n#Person2#: All right, you can check in tonight and I'll make the tests tomorrow morning.
#Person1#: Hello, Martha.\n#Person2#: Hello.\n#Person1#: Did you have a nice holiday?\n#Person2#: Of course.\n#Person1#: Where did you go?\n#Person2#: I went to Fiji.\n#Person1#: Fiji? Was that nice?\n#Person2#: Very nice.\n#Person1#: And how long did you stay there?\n#Person2#: For two weeks.\n#Person1#: And you had a good time, eh?\n#Person2#: Very.\n#Person1#: What did you do, Martha?\n#Person2#: We went swimming, sailing and we played on the sand.\n#Person1#: Great. And what does Fiji look like?\n#Person2#: It has beautiful beaches, palm trees and...\n#Person1#: And the people. What are the people like?\n#Person2#: Really friendly.\n#Person1#: That's great. You're very sunburnt.\n#Person2#: Yes, I know. I've spent much time in the sun.\n#Person1#: Sunbathing?\n#Person2#: Yeah.\n#Person1#: Aha.
#Person1#: Keep going! You can do it! You are strong. Don't give up!\n#Person2#: I didn't know this exercise class was going to be so hard. I need water.\n#Person1#: Hey, what are you doing? I didn't say you could take a break! You are here to lose weight, right? You aren't going to get healthy by drinking water.\n#Person2#: I am thirsty! I can't exercise without water. I hate this class. I'd prefer to exercise alone.\n#Person1#: You need to try harder! You can do it! Keep going! Don't slow down!\n#Person2#: I think I'm done with this class. It's too difficult. I'm out of here.
#Person1#: Can you tell me how to reach the bank,please?\n#Person2#: Which bank? There are two: the Allied Irish Bank and the Bank of Ireland.\n#Person1#: I have an AIB pass card and I want to get money from the bank.\n#Person2#: You need to go to the Allied Irish Bank which is near the local shopping center, Dunnes Stores.\n#Person1#: How do I get there? I have no knowledge of this area.\n#Person2#: Cross the road and turn left at the other side. Walk a long the footpath until you reach the traffic lights. You will see a shopping center on the right hand side. Walk across the road and turn right after the shopping center. Keep going straight for about 100 metres and the bank is to your left.\n#Person1#: It sounds a little bit difficult. How far is it from here?\n#Person2#: It's not so difficult. It's about five minutes' walk from here. I can draw a map for you if you wish.\n#Person1#: Oh, I would really appreciate that.
#Person1#: Hi! Nice to meet you, Nancy! Where were you yesterday?\n#Person2#: I didn't come because I was sick.\n#Person1#: You still look a little sick. You ought to go back to bed.\n#Person2#: I am going home now.\n#Person1#: Did you drive today?\n#Person2#: Oh, No, I don't have a car.\n#Person1#: I can take you home. Would you like a ride?\n#Person2#: Yes. Thanks a lot. Could you stop at the chemist's on the way? I need to buy some medicine.

#Person1#: Hello, Happy Time Catering Services, Vitoria speaking. How can I help you?\n#Person2#: Hello, Victoria. This is Joe Smith from country holidays. I wondered if you could do some catering for us next week, we are having a small reception. It's to launch our summer holiday advertising campaign. Will you be free?\n#Person1#: When exactly is it? Mr. Smith?\n#Person2#: April 21st, that's Thursday. Oh, sorry, no. It should be Friday.\n#Person1#: Oh, yes I can do that where will you be holding it?\n#Person2#: We thought we'd have that at head office and use the conference room, because there is enough room for everyone there.\n#Person1#: Ok. What sort of things would you like?\n#Person2#: Just a light lunch I think, so that people can eat while they move around and talk to each other. You did some thing similar for us last year. We'd be happy to have the same menu again.\n#Person1#: Right. I'll look at my diary and see what you had last time. Oh, I nearly forgot to ask you how many should I cater for?\n#Person2#: Well, I think most people will be able to come, perhaps around 30. No, let's say 35, to be sure.\n#Person1#: Right, thank you for getting in touch, Mr. Smith. I'll send you confirmation of the arrangements by the end of this week.\n#Person2#: Ok.
#Person1#: So how long have you been living in London?\n#Person2#: Er, a couple of years. How long have you been working here?\n#Person1#: Only a few months. I moved down here for the job. There was no work for me where I came from.\n#Person2#: Where did you come from then?\n#Person1#: I came from a small village called Arnside near Lancaster a year ago. There was nothing there. So I moved to London.\n#Person2#: Do you enjoy working here in this restaurant?\n#Person1#: Very much so.
#Person1#: Still feeling ill?\n#Person2#: Yes. And that medicine hasn't helped. Not a good start to our vacation, I'm afraid.\n#Person1#: Do you have any idea what caused it?\n#Person2#: Well, I thought it might be last night's dinner.\n#Person1#: But I am fine. Could it be the heat? It's enough to make anyone ill.\n#Person2#: I know. But we've been here a week now. Anyway, I've been careful in the sun and I've been drinking bottled water.\n#Person1#: Then we'd better stay in the hotel today.
#Person1#: Can I help you, Miss?\n#Person2#: No, thanks, I'm just looking. How much is that necklace?\n#Person1#: 2,999 dollars.\n#Person2#: Too expensive! My sister's birthday is tomorrow. I'm thinking what I should buy for her.\n#Person1#: You'll find that the prices of our goods are quite reasonable.\n#Person2#: Well, that's certainly nice to know. I'll take it.\n#Person1#: It's a good choice. I'm sure she'll love it. Cash or card, Miss?\n#Person2#: I hope so. Card, please.\n#Person1#: That comes to 3,199 dollars with tax. Please sign here.

May I help you?\n#Person2#: I'd like to talk to the director about my plan to go home next week.\n#Person1#: Are you one of the students from England?\n#Person2#: No, I'm from the United States. I came last May.\n#Person1#: I see. The director can see you next Monday.

We'll expect you then at 9:00 o'clock on Monday morning.\n#Person2#: Thank you very much.
#Person1#: What's up? Are you still studying?\n#Person2#: Yeah, I'll be at it all night.\n#Person1#: When's the big test?\n#Person2#: Not for 3 days. But I have too many things to remember before then.\n#Person1#: You're taking this Spanish class so seriously. Don't you think you should lighten up a bit?\n#Person2#: I can't. Not only do I need to get good grades, but I also have to actually learn this stuff. Next year, I'm applying to a nursing program. And they give special financial help to students who speak 2 languages.\n#Person1#: Come on, you'll do fine. You always do fine.\n#Person2#: Only when I study hard.\n#Person1#: OK, but can't you take a little break? Hey, you should come get some fish with me. You know fish is actually very good for your brain.
#Person1#: What can I do for you, Sir?\n#Person2#: I'm Tom in room 508, and I want a wake-up call tomorrow morning.\n#Person1#: At what time?\n#Person2#: 6:15 am, please.\n#Person1#: No problem, we have a computer wake-up service. Please dial 2 first and then the time. That is to say, dial 2 and then 0615.\n#Person2#: I see. I should dial all the numbers 20615 in turn. Thank you. By the way, if I want to change my wake up time, what shall I do?\n#Person1#: Just dial your new wake up time, the computer will record the new wake up time and delete the previous numbers automatically.\n#Person2#: If I dial 20700, I will be waked up at 7:00 am, am I right?\n#Person1#: Yes, quite right.\n#Person2#: Thank you. Goodnight.
#Person1#: Mr. Sharp, thank you for giving me this interview. So, my first question is, are you happy with your life?\n#Person2#: Am I happy? You may know you are the first person to have asked me this question directly. The others dared not because they were afraid I might say yes. They wanted me to say no so that they could make up stories about me.\n#Person1#: What kind of stories?\n#Person2#: Brian Sharpe, author of over 100 historical novels, lives in a lonely house 30 miles away from Sydney. But is he happy?\n#Person1#: Is that why you have refused many interviews?\n#Person2#: I'm tired of being told that I must be unhappy because I'm rich and successful. I'm not unhappy.\n#Person1#: Understood. And I'm wondering if you follow a similar pattern of writing.\n#Person2#: I know what you mean. Do I write similar stories? I say no.\n#Person1#: So, how do you create your heroes?\n#Person2#: My heroes live? They think for themselves. All their stories are drawn from life, my life, my friends' lives, including my friends in many books.\n#Person1#: Sounds good to me.
#Person1#: Hi Miya, how are you?\n#Person2#: I'm very well, thanks. But I'm crazy busy these days. How are you?\n#Person1#: Fine, thanks. Why are you so busy?\n#Person2#: I have a Chinese test next week.\n#Person1#: Come on, I believe you can pass it, your spoken Chinese is good enough.\n#Person2#: Uh, speaking is one thing, exam is another thing I'm afraid.\n#Person1#: Anyway, do you want to have a coffee now?\n#Person2#: Ok, but I don't have much time. I have to go to the library.\n#Person1#: It won't take long, let's go to the cafe.\n#Person2#: Ok.
#Person1#: Hello Tom, do you mean your going away?\n#Person2#: Oh yes, I've booked the ticket and it's time for me to go back home.\n#Person1#: Well, how long have you been in China?\n#Person2#: I've been here for 2 years.\n#Person1#: Did you enjoy your stay?\n#Person2#: Yes, indeed. I should say. I've had a wonderful time over the past 2 years. You and Xiao Fang have given me a lot of help. People here are very friendly. Thank you all very much.\n#Person1#: When are you leaving?\n#Person2#: I'm off next Sunday. I've come to say goodbye today.\n#Person1#: I'd like to invite you to dinner before you go. What about Friday?\n#Person2#: I'm free on Friday. I'd like to come. Would you please ask Xiao Fang to be there, too?\n#Person1#: Of course I will.
#Person1#: We need to have a serious talk.\n#Person2#: About what?\n#Person1#: Your attendance or rather lack of it.\n#Person2#: OK, so I've missed a few classes.\n#Person1#: A few classes? I've been told you've missed 6 out of 8 times in 2 different classes. That's really setting yourself up to fail. You're about to be in big trouble.\n#Person2#: What's the big deal about missing some classes?\n#Person1#: The big deal is that you're here on a student visa.\n#Person2#: So?\n#Person1#: So if you don't attend classes regularly, you won't be a full time student which your visa requires.\n#Person2#: What are you going to do? Turn me into the police?\n#Person1#: Oh, of course I'll have to report you if you continue missing your classes, then I'm afraid you'll have to pack your things.

We can talk and listen to music on the way.\n#Person1#: How long are you staying for?\n#Person2#: Just 5 days. Oh, I have to pack now. I'll call you when I come back.\n#Person1#: OK. Bye.

We have an express train departing every morning and an overnight train that departs at nine pm.\n#Person1#: How long does it take to get there?\n#Person2#: About twelve hours. We currently have tickets available only for first class on the express train.

I'm nowhere close to being tired.\n#Person1#: I really don't care, just go to sleep.\n#Person2#: What if I stay up and do something, until I get tired?\n#Person1#: You'll be up all night if I let you do that.\n#Person2#: I'm going to get to sleep eventually.\n#Person1#: You need to go to sleep now, so go to sleep.\n#Person2#: Good night.

What else can it be?\n#Person2#: I see. It's interesting that there is also a parrot in my English book. His mane is Polly.\n#Person1#: Really? A foreign parrot!\n#Person2#: He can speak English, too.\n#Person1#: Maybe you can teach Lulu some English words.\n#Person2#: Lulu. Lulu. Say hello. hello. Oh, she is so smart. Good bird.
#Person1#: The product's selling points is its advanced technoledge.\n#Person2#: Unfortunately, it's just too expensive for majority of consumer to afford.\n#Person1#: Why is the price so high?\n#Person2#: It's not just that the price is high, it's that the overhead to update an entire computer system to be compatible is costly.\n#Person1#: Model of computers aren't compatible?\n#Person2#: Most current computer systems simply can't handle it because this model truly has extraordinary capabilities.\n#Person1#: Maybe after the next generation of technology comes out, the price of this model will become more affordable.\n#Person2#: But by then, the technology will be outdated.\n#Person1#: True, but our focus has never been affordability anyway. Coastwise, we may not be very competitive, but qualitywise, we definitely have an edge.\n#Person2#: That's right, no one else has a product on the market now that is comparable.\n#Person1#: This model has advanced technoledge, superior components, it is compact, and it's a top-quality product.\n#Person2#: I guess you get what you pay for.
#Person1#: How about going to the cinema tonight?\n#Person2#: That's great. What's on tonight?\n#Person1#: I am not sure about the name of the film, but I know it's a romantic one.\n#Person2#: Romantic?

#Person1#: Hi, Jack, how have you been?\n#Person2#: Not very well.\n#Person1#: Why? Looks like you're feeling very down! What happened?\n#Person2#: Nothing.\n#Person1#: Come on. For a man who's feeling so, down, there're usually two reasons. Either his career is going downhill, or he has a broken heart. Since you're so successful, it must be the latter.\n#Person2#: Well, you're right. I just broke up with Jane.\n#Person1#: Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you two were made for each ocher.\n#Person2#: Well, you never know. I'm ready for a commitment and want to settle down, but she says she wants to pursue her career while she's still young.\n#Person1#: Well, she is not to blame. It's always difficult to choose between career and family.\n#Person2#: Maybe you're right.\n#Person1#: Jack, I don't know what to say to comfort you, but cheer up! There are plenty of fish in the sea and you'll find your soul mate, your perfect match!\n#Person2#: Yeah, but it's hard to forget her at moment. You know, we were together for almost five years. It's really hard...
#Person1#: Your mp3 looks so cool. Where did you get it?\n#Person2#: I bought it online.\n#Person1#: Really? Do you often shop online?\n#Person2#: Yes. I buy most of my daily necessities online.\n#Person1#: I've never tried E-shopping. Is it better than shopping at an actual store?\n#Person2#: Yes, much better. You can log in a website, browse through many items and categories comfortably at home, order the goods, pay by credit or debit card, and the goods will be delivered to your home.\n#Person1#: Wounds good, and I don't have to queue up at the cashier.\n#Person2#: And you can still go'window shopping'just like in a real shopping mall.\n#Person1#: Well, are there any other advantages?\n#Person2#: Yes, most of the shops are closed at 22:00 or even earlier, but the internet operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and can be accessed anywhere.\n#Person1#: Are there many choices of online shopping?\n#Person2#: Sure. You can buy almost anything you can think of.\n#Person1#: Perhaps I should have a try.
#Person1#: Is there anything I can help you with?\n#Person2#: Yes, thank you. I am really far behind on this project. Could you help me with the extra typing or xeroxing?\n#Person1#: I can do either one.\n#Person2#: Good. That would be very helpful. Can you start with those pages over there?\n#Person1#: No problem.\n#Person2#: Thank you very much! How long have you been working here?\n#Person1#: I have been working here for 5 years.\n#Person2#: Well, we have some special projects coming up. Would you be interested in working on any of those?\n#Person1#: Yes, I would love to work on a special project!\n#Person2#: Well then, I'll keep you in the loop. Thank you for your help today.
#Person1#: How can I help you?\n#Person2#: Yes, I would like to look at some of your products. I think what I am using now does not fit me well.\n#Person1#: We have a full range of products from cosmetics to skin cleansers.\n#Person2#: What do you have in foundation?\n#Person1#: Our foundation is of very super quality. We only use the finest ingredients. It will moisturize your skin and it can protect your skin from UVA and UVB.\n#Person2#: What colors do you have in foundation?\n#Person1#: Let me show you. We have six colors\n#Person2#: The color I use now is natural beige. How much do you sell it for?\n#Person1#: 250 Yuan.\n#Person2#: That's expensive.\n#Person1#: What you're paying for, madam, is the ingredients. it provides a soft and perfect finish coverage with a weightless feel.\n#Person2#: I understand. I need a lipstick, too. Do you have lipsticks in red?\n#Person1#: Of course. But I suggest you buy a lipgloss. The shining effect is in.\n#Person2#: All right. How much is it?\n#Person1#: 45 Yuan. If you buy the two, you can get a small bottle of nail polish for free.\n#Person2#: Well, I'll take them.
#Person1#: Hello, Sunshine Travel Agency.\n#Person2#: Hello. Is there a package tour to Beijing?\n#Person1#: Well, let me see. We have a nice one on which we still have several unfilled places.\n#Person2#: Does the tour have a Chinese-speaking guide?\n#Person1#: Yes, sir.\n#Person2#: What is the cost of the tour?\n#Person1#: Five hundred dollars altogether.\n#Person2#: It's a bit expensive. Can you tell me the schedule?\n#Person1#: Yes, I will introduce the itinerary in detail.
#Person1#: We'Ve been over this a thousand times. The data is irrefutable! Look, we'Ve done extensive research, built studies, and read the literature, and there is conclusive evidence to support my theory!\n#Person2#: Horowitz, I beg to differ. Even in your most recent study, the investigative approach was flawed! You know as well as I do that the collection of data was not systematic, and there is a large margin of error. To draw a definitive conclusion based on that data would be misleading\n#Person1#: That is preposterous!\n#Person2#: You are trying to single-handedly solve one of the world's greatest mysteries, and yet you are oblivious to the fact that you are wrong!\n#Person1#: I am not wrong! The chicken came first!\n#Person2#: No! The egg came first!
#Person1#: You said you like classical music very much. Then who is your favorite opera star?\n#Person2#: There are three of them, the Three Tenors.\n#Person1#: Oh, you mean Pavarotti, Domingo and Carreras. Have you been to their live shows?\n#Person2#: Yeah, it's really a unique experience. It's a solo concert by Pavarotti. He put on the performance in the Forbidden City in Beijing.\n#Person1#: I've heard of that one. It was also his swan song.\n#Person2#: Besides, speaking of classical music, we should never forget about the New Year's Concert.\n#Person1#: Of course not. People all over the world watch it on TV, or listen to it on the radio.\n#Person2#: Sure. It's undoubtedly one of the biggest classical music events. Have you ever been to the live show?\n#Person1#: Yes, I went to the New Year's Concert in 2005.\n#Person2#: Wow, you are so lucky. I saw that one on TV. But it must be so different to be there in the concert hall.\n#Person1#: That's for sure. You know, it's really amazing to be in the best concert hall, listening to the performance by the best orchestra. I had the greatest time ever.\n#Person2#: Who was the conductor at that event?\n#Person1#: Lorin Maazel. He did an amazing job. Moreover, he just celebrated his 75th birthday.\n#Person2#: So cool. I wish I can go to the live New Year's Concert someday in the future.\n#Person1#: The right opportunity for you would come along soon. You know, music is transnational.\n#Person2#: I believe in that. Well, the performance is about to begin. Let's be quiet.
#Person1#: I like to stay here.\n#Person2#: Why?\n#Person1#: People are very kind down your way. You're lucky.\n#Person2#: Yes, do you always gather to welcome new comers?\n#Person1#: Never.\n#Person2#: Really?\n#Person1#: Yeah. People down our way hardly speak to each other.
#Person1#: Are you cold?\n#Person2#: Yes, a little.\n#Person1#: I wonder if we can change the temperature.\n#Person2#: I tried before. There are no buttons on the air conditioning.\n#Person1#: There must be buttons. How do they turn it on and off?\n#Person2#: I think it is centrally controlled. They control it at the main desk.\n#Person1#: Well, they have it too cold in here. I want to be warmer. I won't be able to sleep.\n#Person2#: I'm going downstairs for more drinking water. I will ask them.\n#Person1#: What did they say about the air conditioning?\n#Person2#: They said it is centrally controlled. All the rooms are the same. They can't change it.\n#Person1#: That's stupid. How can I sleep in this?\n#Person2#: You can wear more clothes.
#Person1#: Hello, Kate! How are you doing?\n#Person2#: Fine, thanks. How are you?\n#Person1#: Fine. How are your term papers?\n#Person2#: Oh my lord. I haven't really started them.\n#Person1#: How could it be? They are due two weeks later.\n#Person2#: I know but I was busy with my part-time job the last few days.\n#Person1#: Kate, you know, I am thinking of getting a part-time job next year because I really need more money and I don't want to ask my parents for any more. But I'm so busy! How am I going to work and study? How do you do it? Do you have some good tips on budgeting time?\n#Person2#: To be honest with you, Jason, I don't think I'm doing a very good job of balancing my schoolwork with my job. I'm always two steps behind. I've got to get back to the dorm and continue writing that paper. Say! Why don't you talk to your advisor? And let me know!\n#Person1#: My advisor?
#Person1#: Could I order dinner?\n#Person2#: Of course. What would you like?\n#Person1#: I want a bottle of champagne, lobster tail, and filet mignon, medium rare.\n#Person2#: I'm so sorry. We ran out of filet mignon. May I suggest the porterhouse instead?\n#Person1#: That's too bad, but the porterhouse will be okay.\n#Person2#: May I be so bold as to suggest chocolate-covered strawberries with the champagne?\n#Person1#: Not tonight, thank you.\n#Person2#: No strawberries. We'll charge your amenities account, if that's okay.\n#Person1#: Charge it to whatever account you like.\n#Person2#: Your meal will be delivered as soon as it's all ready. Enjoy!
#Person1#: Even with volume sales our costs for the Exec User won't go down much.\n#Person2#: Just what are you proposing?\n#Person1#: We could take a cut on the price. But 25 % would reduce much our profit margin. We suggest a compromise 10 %.\n#Person2#: That's a big change from 25 %! 10 % is beyond my negotiating limit. Any other ideas?\n#Person1#: I don't think I can change it right now. Why don't we talk again tomorrow?\n#Person2#: Sure. I have to talk to my office anyway. I hope we can find some common ground on this.\n#Person1#: Robert, I have been instructed to reject the numbers you proposed, but we can try to come up with something else.\n#Person2#: I hope so, Dana. My instructions are to negotiate hard on this deal, but I'm trying very hard to reach some middle ground.\n#Person1#: I understand. We propose a structured deal. For the first six months, we get a discount of 20 % and the next six months we get 15 %.\n#Person2#: Dana. I can't bring those numbers back to my office, they'll turn it down flat.\n#Person1#: Then you'll have to think of something better, Robert.
#Person1#: How can I help you?\n#Person2#: Yes, I am James Mason from Anderson and Associates Limited. I would like to see Mr. Smith.\n#Person1#: Do you have an appointment?\n#Person2#: Yes, he knows I'm coming. Our meeting is set for 2 o'clock.\n#Person1#: I wonder if Mr. Smith forgot your meeting. I am afraid he left this office this morning and is not expected back until 4 p. m. Let me find out if he made arrangements for someone else to meet with you in his place. Will you please have a seat?\n#Person2#: Sure.\n#Person1#: Yes, Mr. Mason. I just checked with our office manager, Ms. Terry. She said Mr. Smith briefed her on your project. She is just finishing up a meeting now. She should be with you shortly. Would you like me to show you around while you are waiting?\n#Person2#: That would be very nice. Thank you.\n#Person1#: Right this way, Mr. Mason. We can start with our front office. When Ms. Terry is ready, you may take the elevator at the front to the 6th floor. There is a conference room already prepared.
#Person1#: What do you want to eat today?\n#Person2#: I feel like having some dumplings. Let's go out to eat.\n#Person1#: No need! I know how to make dumplings. Let's do it from scratch. Can you give me a hand in the kitchen? I don't think I can finish everything by myself.\n#Person2#: Of course. What do you want me to do?\n#Person1#: Just trim vegetables for cooking. I will cut up the meat.\n#Person2#: I can do that. And I would like to make dumplings later.\n#Person1#: Yeah, you are my good helper, Steven.\n#Person2#: Absolutely.
#Person1#: My stay is over. Here's the key to my room.\n#Person2#: Thank you. And here's your receipt, sir.\n#Person1#: Many thanks.\n#Person2#: I hope your stay here was satisfactory, sir.\n#Person1#: This could be a great hotel, once you get rid of the insects. The city itself is great.\n#Person2#: I'm glad that the little problem didn't ruin your visit. Please have a pleasant trip home.
#Person1#: Hello?\n#Person2#: Hi Vicky.\n#Person1#: Are you there yet?\n#Person2#: Yes.\n#Person1#: I just got off the subway. I'm almost there. Sorry I'm late.\n#Person2#: That's no problem. I just wanted to tell you I'm inside.\n#Person1#: Where are you?\n#Person2#: On the second floor.\n#Person1#: Should I come to the second floor or do you want to come to the first floor?\n#Person2#: Come upstairs.\n#Person1#: What?\n#Person2#: Oh, Can you hear me OK? I said, come to the second floor.\n#Person1#: Oh, OK. What are you doing there?\n#Person2#: Just looking at some books on how to learn English.\n#Person1#: Do you want to get something to eat later?\n#Person2#: No, I'm still full from dinner.\n#Person1#: What do you want to do?\n#Person2#: I don't know for sure. When you get here we'll talk about it.\n#Person1#: OK, see you soon.\n#Person2#: Bye.
#Person1#: Good evening, sir. What's your pleasure?\n#Person2#: Give me a shot of whisky and soda.\n#Person1#: With or without ice, sir?\n#Person2#: Certainly without ice. Ice will spoil the taste.\n#Person1#: Would you like to say 'when', please, sir. ( Pouring soda )\n#Person2#: Whoa, when.\n#Person1#: Enjoy your drink, sir.
#Person1#: I'm sorry, Julia! I can't get home early this evening.\n#Person2#: What? But today is my birthday!\n#Person1#: I know, darling. But I do have a lot of work to do, hope you can understand me.\n#Person2#: But Steven, why don't you ask for a leave? . . . Steven, why don't you speak? Are you still there?\n#Person1#: Hello, Julia? I can't hear you clearly. I'm afraid the line is out of order. Okay, B, listen! How about I hang up now and call you back later?\n#Person2#: Okay! Bye!
#Person1#: Are you looking for part time or full time employment?\n#Person2#: To start with I would like something part time with the hope that it can develop into something full time.\n#Person1#: So you are interested in being with a company for the long term?\n#Person2#: Yes, that's right. I like this city very much and would like to make my home here.\n#Person1#: Here is an application. Please fill it out to the best of your ability. Did you bring a resume and references?\n#Person2#: Yes, I did. I have them here.\n#Person1#: Keep them until you ready to give me the application and you can turn them all in at once.\n#Person2#: Thank you very much. This should only take me a few minutes.
#Person1#: Hello! I'd like to get busy on my computer, but I need some broadband.\n#Person2#: There's an Ethernet cable in your room. Just plug it into the back of your laptop.\n#Person1#: Uh-oh! I can't use Ethernet. My computer is wireless only.\n#Person2#: That's okay. I can tell you about some alternatives we have.\n#Person1#: Any alternative that works will be great.\n#Person2#: Well, there's our computer lab on the first floor.\n#Person1#: That sounds good. What's the charge?\n#Person2#: The lab and the computers are no charge, but you have to pay for whatever you print.\n#Person1#: That sounds good. Now, how about the other alternatives?\n#Person2#: Of course. Our lobby is set up for wireless, so just bring your computer down here.\n#Person1#: Use my laptop in the lobby? That's great! Now, if I need to print something there?\n#Person2#: They plan to install a printer here. But until then, you'll have to use the lab.
#Person1#: Have you seen the news today?\n#Person2#: Not yet. What happened?\n#Person1#: Did you know there was a blackout last night?\n#Person2#: Yes, I heard the lights were out all night.\n#Person1#: Well, some people decided to loot last night.\n#Person2#: I don't understand.\n#Person1#: They took advantage of the blackout.\n#Person2#: They really started looting?\n#Person1#: Yes, apparently four stores were broken into.\n#Person2#: Did the looters get caught?\n#Person1#: There was no evidence of who did it.\n#Person2#: Hopefully we won't have any more blackouts.
#Person1#: The weather is terrible.\n#Person2#: Yes. It was sunny and warm yesterday but the wind is really blowing hard now.\n#Person1#: I'm wearing my heavy jacket.\n#Person2#: I'm going to put on more clothes, too.\n#Person1#: Will it snow today?\n#Person2#: I don't know. Do you like snowing?\n#Person1#: Yes, when it snows, every where is white. It's very beautiful.\n#Person2#: You can read the newspaper. Maybe it will tell you whether it will snow or not.\n#Person1#: Good idea.
#Person1#: Hey Sarah, I'm having some trouble finding an apartment. Can you help me look at some listings online?\n#Person2#: Sure. What kind of apartment are you looking for?\n#Person1#: Well, it has to be cheap. I don't want a really expensive apartment.\n#Person2#: OK. Would you like to live in a studio?\n#Person1#: Sure, a studio would be fine.
#Person1#: Hi, Sue. How's it going?\n#Person2#: Oh, hi, Frank, just fine. How are your classes?\n#Person1#: Pretty good. I'm glad this is my last term here, though.\n#Person2#: Why is that? I thought you were enjoying school.\n#Person1#: I was. But now I'm getting tired of it. I'm ready for the real world.\n#Person2#: What are you planning to do when you graduate?\n#Person1#: First, I want to get a job as a computer programmer, and then after five years or so, I'd like to start my own business.\n#Person2#: Sounds good. I still have three terms to go until I'm done.\n#Person1#: You'll make it for sure. Well, see you later.\n#Person2#: Bye!
#Person1#: Hi, Jane. Come in.\n#Person2#: Uh, yeah, I stopped by to see if you were still looking for a roommate to share your house.\n#Person1#: Yeah, I sure am. Let me show you the place. Uh, here's the living room.\n#Person2#: Oh. It looks like you could use a new carpet.., and those stains?\n#Person1#: Well. I've had a few problems with some former roommates. I know it needs to be cleaned, but I just don't have the money to do it right now.\n#Person2#: Oh. And what about the kitchen?\n#Person1#: Right this way. Look. It's completely furnished with all the latest appliances, except...\n#Person2#: What?\n#Person1#: Well, the refrigerator door is broken.., a little bit.., and it won't shut all the way. It needs fixing, but don't worry. I've just pushed a box against it to keep it shut.\n#Person2#: Hmm. Great.\n#Person1#: Ah. It isn't that bad.\n#Person2#: Well, how about the bathroom?\n#Person1#: Well...\n#Person2#: Hey, I think I've seen enough. I can't believe you've survived under these conditions.\n#Person1#: So what do you think? You really can't beat a place like this for $ 450 month. So it has its problems, but we can fix those.\n#Person2#: Uh, no, thank you. I think I've seen enough.
#Person1#: Can I have breakfast in my room?\n#Person2#: Certainly, madam. Breakfast is served in your room from 7 o'clock until 9. Here's the menu.\n#Person1#: I'd like to have Chinese food.\n#Person2#: Yes, madam. And at what time would you like it?\n#Person1#: About eight o'clock, I think.\n#Person2#: Very good, madam. And what kind of fruit juice would you like?\n#Person1#: I'd like orange, please.\n#Person2#: Orange juice. And would you prefer tea or milk?\n#Person1#: Tea, please.\n#Person2#: Thank you very much. Good night.
#Person1#: Hello, Jack! Do you think you can give me a lift to the station? I must go there to pick my sister.\n#Person2#: I'm terribly sorry, but I can't. I have to be at work by 8:30. I can call you a taxi, though.
#Person1#: Hello, I have just seen your advertisement. You haven't rented it out yet, have you?\n#Person2#: No, I haven't. Come in and have a look.\n#Person1#: Thank you.\n#Person2#: It's just a simple room. My son used to live in it. Now he is grown and long gone, and my husband died last year. So I thought maybe I'd take in a roomer.\n#Person1#: A nice, quiet house. That's what I'm looking for.\n#Person2#: This way, Sir.\n#Person1#: Oh, this is a very pleasant room. How much is the rent?\n#Person2#: Fifty dollars a week. I won't charge you anything for electricity, gas and heat. Oh, yes, you can use the kitchen and refrigerator too.\n#Person1#: Well, I like this place very much. But, you know, my government doesn't give me much money. So you know what I mean.\n#Person2#: Oh, yes. You seem like a very nice young man. What about $ 40?\n#Person1#: That's good, Mrs. ...\n#Person2#: Price. Susan Price.\n#Person1#: My name is Wang Li. I've just come from China to study at the university.\n#Person2#: Oh, isn't that lovely?\n#Person1#: May I move in tomorrow morning. Mrs. Price.\n#Person2#: Fine. I'll be expecting you around ten. If you don't mind, I'd like to have the first two weeks' rent in advance.\n#Person1#: OK. I'll give it to you tomorrow morning. See you tomorrow.
#Person1#: Can we make you an offer? We would like to run the campaign for four extra weeks.\n#Person2#: Well, can we summarize the problem from my point of view? First of all, the campaign was late. It missed two important trade affairs. The ads also did not appear into key magazines. As a result, the campaign failed. Do you accept that summary of what happened?\n#Person1#: Well, the delay wasn't entirely our fault. You did in fact make late changes to the specifications of the advertisements.\n#Person2#: Uh, actually, you were late with the initial proposals so you have very little time and in fact, we only asked for small changes.\n#Person1#: Well whatever, can we repeat our offer to run the campaign for 4 extra weeks?\n#Person2#: That's not really the point. The campaign missed two key trade affairs. Because of this, we are asking you either to repeat the campaign next year for free, or we only pay 50% of the fee for this year.\n#Person1#: Could we suggest a 20% reduction to the fee together with the four week sustention to the campaign.\n#Person2#: We are not happy. We lost business.\n#Person1#: I think we both made mistakes. The responsibility is on both sides.\n#Person2#: Ok, let's suggest a new solution. How about a 40% cut in fee, or a free repeat campaign?\n#Person1#: Well, let's take a break, we're not getting very far. Perhaps we should think about this.
#Person1#: Excuse me. Would you please make a suit with this material? \n#Person2#: Sure. May I take your measurements? \n#Person1#: Please don't make it too tight. This is for autumn wear, so make sure you allow for a cardigan underneath. \n#Person2#: I see, sir. Can you come back for a fitting on the 10th, that's in a week's time? \n#Person1#: The 10th? I'm sorry, but you see I'm going to attend an international conference on the 11th. Could you have the suit ready by the 8th, or at the latest, the 9th? \n#Person2#: Well, a business suit usually takes ten days' time. But in your case, we'll try to have it ready sooner. How about coming for your fitting on the 8th? Then your suit will be ready for you on the 10th? \n#Person1#: That's fine, thank you. 
#Person1#: what happened? Why didn't he win? \n#Person2#: didn't you hear? He was disqualified. \n#Person1#: how did that happen? He's so talented! I thought he had a great chance of winning a gold medal! \n#Person2#: if he didn't have any drug problems, he would have won. \n#Person1#: what? What kind of drugs was he using? \n#Person2#: he was taking steroids to make him stronger and faster. \n#Person1#: I thought that all athletes were supposed to be regularly tested for drugs. \n#Person2#: they are. The reason why they didn't disqualify him until after the race is because the results from the text only came back afterwards. \n#Person1#: that's so disappointing. I don't know why top athletes would feel the need to take drugs. \n#Person2#: I don't think it's right, but I can understand why they might. Imagine how much pressure there would be to win for your country! \n#Person1#: regardless of how much pressure you're under, there's never a good reason to take drugs. \n#Person2#: I agree. Hopefully with the new regulations, fewer athletes will try to cheat with drugs. \n#Person1#: let's hope so. 
#Person1#: Hi, Cindy. I thought I'd missed you. \n#Person2#: Oh, I am very sorry, Hans. Thank you for waiting for me. You must have been here a long time already. \n#Person1#: It's all right. \n#Person2#: I was caught in the heavy rain, or I would have come earlier. I am sorry I kept you waiting. \n#Person1#: I was in a comfortable place, so really, it's no problem. I am happy to see you. Did the rain hold you up long? \n#Person2#: Yes. When I came out of the subway, it was raining cats and dogs. And I forgot my umbrella. So I had to wait for the rain to let up. \n#Person1#: I totally understand. 
#Person1#: You don't look too well. Maybe you should take the day off from work. \n#Person2#: I couldn't do that. I have an important meeting to go to today. \n#Person1#: Do you feel ok? \n#Person2#: Not really. After a 12-hour flight, I've got jetlag, and on top of that, I think I've also got the flu. \n#Person1#: Why don't you call your secretary and tell her to reschedule the meeting? You should really get some rest or you'll end up feeling even worse than you do now. \n#Person2#: Could you feel my forehead and check to see if I have a fever? \n#Person1#: You're really hot. Let me get you some Tylenol to bring the fever down. \n#Person2#: Ok. I'll stay home this morning and rest, but if I feel better in the afternoon, I'm going to the meeting. \n#Person1#: Zach, what's that on your arm? \n#Person2#: I don't know. It looks a bit red, but I'm sure it's nothing. \n#Person1#: It looks like you have a red rash all over you! Are you allergic to anything? \n#Person2#: Just cats, but I don't think I was near any cats in the last couple of weeks. \n#Person1#: I completely forgot about your cat allergy. I took care of a cat for my friend here a few days ago. Oh no. we'd better go to the doctor and get some medicine. Let's go. \n#Person2#: Shouldn't we make an appointment first? \n#Person1#: We sould, but let's just go and see if there's an opening now before it gets worse. \n#Person2#: Whatever you say. I just want to get to my meeting! 
#Person1#: Please show me the menu, Miss. \n#Person2#: Of course. Here you are. Can I take your order now? \n#Person1#: Yes. I'd like an Italian soup to start with and then some fried noodles. \n#Person2#: All right. Can I serve you anything else? \n#Person1#: Yes, I'd like another cup of coffee afterwards. Make it hot, please. \n#Person2#: You've got it, sir. 
#Person1#: Hey, let me show you the place. Eh, here's the living room.\n#Person2#: Oh, it looks like you could use a new carpet.\n#Person1#: Well, I've had a few problems with some former roommates. I know it needs to be cleaned. But I just don't have the money to do it right now.\n#Person2#: Oh, and what about the kitchen?\n#Person1#: Well, the refrigerator door is broken a little bit, and it won't shut all the way, but it isn't that bad.\n#Person2#: How about the bathroom?\n#Person1#: Eh, the window needs fixing.\n#Person2#: Hey, I think I've seen enough. I can't believe you've survived under these conditions.
#Person1#: Hi, Maggie. I saw your painting in the end of year school art exhibition that all the parents went to. It was great.\n#Person2#: Well, our art teacher seemed really pleased with it, but I'm not sure what the parents thought about.\n#Person1#: Oh, don't worry. I only heard them saying good things about it.\n#Person2#: Hmm...He probably didn't notice that I hadn't used the right colors.\n#Person1#: I don't think anyone noticed.\n#Person2#: No, but I did. But it was too late to do anything about it. Well, next time I'll do something better hopefully.
#Person1#: Hi. My name's Mary Jackson and I have a friend Susan, whose son Bobby is taking gymnastic lessons from you. She suggested I call you.\n#Person2#: OK. Will the lessons be for yourself or a child?\n#Person1#: They will be for myself. My son's only 3 and I'd like him to start taking lessons next year.\n#Person2#: Very well. Do you like sports or do you have another reason for taking up lessons?\n#Person1#: I like sports.\n#Person2#: Then what would you like to learn?\n#Person1#: I'd like to learn how to be a gymnasts. I also want to help my son study gymnastics.\n#Person2#: Good. We'll fix a date then.\n#Person1#: Thank you. How about on the weekends? Can you spare some time?\n#Person2#: OK. I'll just check my calendar and we'll call you later when I know for certain. Bye.
#Person1#: Good news.\n#Person2#: What's it?\n#Person1#: The IOC President Thomas Bach announced the winner just now.\n#Person2#: What winner?\n#Person1#: Sally Bookworm. Beijing's got the right to host the twenty fourth Winter Olympic Games in 2022.\n#Person2#: That's really good news. Tell me something further please.\n#Person1#: Beijing and it's cold bitter Zhangjiakou 144 nods against all Marty's 40 in the voting becoming the first city to host both summer and winter Olympics.\n#Person2#: Wonderful. I'll do something for the Winter Olympic Games from now on.
#Person1#: Lucy, I heard that you got a part-time job. Is that true?\n#Person2#: Yes Jack, I am working as a guide in our cities museum. I explained basic details about pictures, items and the like to the visitors.\n#Person1#: That sounds like a hard job. You must have to learn a lot about history.\n#Person2#: I do, but that's ok. I like reading about the past, history helps us to know what to do in our present situation. I love the job.\n#Person1#: You will learn a lot in this job.\n#Person2#: And most importantly, I can get some good work experience.
#Person1#: Look at you, you are so cute. Hey, does this guy have a name?\n#Person2#: Yes, that's Hopper. We call him that because of how he likes to jump around and eat a lot of carrots.\n#Person1#: He seems to be getting along with the other animals, too.\n#Person2#: All of the animals you see here have been rescued, and in most cases, they are separated from their mothers. They're all like brothers and sisters.\n#Person1#: I have a dog and a cat at home. Do you think it would be too stressful for him?\n#Person2#: Not at all. As long as your animals are well trained, it shouldn't be a problem. You should get a cage for him, though.\n#Person1#: Is he healthy? Or does he need to be taken to an animal doctor first?\n#Person2#: He's 100% healthy.\n#Person1#: I'll take him. Come here, Hopper.
#Person1#: Good afternoon, I would like to speak with the manager, please.\n#Person2#: Why? What's your problem?\n#Person1#: Well, I just picked up a TV at your store yesterday afternoon. And when I was taking it out of the car. It sort of accidentally fell. It looks ok. But the picture is pretty unclear. Do you think I can have someone look at it or get it changed?\n#Person2#: Ok, I will talk to the manager about it right now, please wait a moment.\n#Person1#: Ok, thank you.\n#Person2#: Well, we can have someone repair it for you, but as it was caused by you. I'm afraid you have to pay for half of the repair cost and we will pay the other half\n#Person1#: That will be fine. Thank you.
#Person1#: Anna, your wedding day is this weekend. Are you ready?\n#Person2#: Yeah, I think so, except for one thing. I'm supposed to wear some special things to the wedding for good luck.\n#Person1#: I've thought you were planning to wear a wedding dress.\n#Person2#: I am of course, but it says that to have a happy marriage, I have to wear something old, something new, something borrowed and something blue.\n#Person1#: I've never heard about that. So what are you going to wear?\n#Person2#: Well, for something old, I'm wearing my grandmother's diamond ring. And my wedding dresse is something new and I'm wearing blue flowers in my hair.\n#Person1#: OK. That's something old, new, and blue. You still need something borrowed.\n#Person2#: Yeah, I just don't know what though.\n#Person1#: Hey! How 'bout this? It's my lucky coin. I always wear it inside my shoe when I need good luck. You can borrow it and put it in your shoe during the wedding.\n#Person2#: Oh, thanks. Now I'm ready for my wedding day.
#Person1#: Royal Hotel, can I help you?\n#Person2#: Yes. I urgently need a room for tomorrow night, and do you have any vacancies?\n#Person1#: Yes, we have. What kind of room would you like?\n#Person2#: I'd like a suite with an ocean view, please.\n#Person1#: No problem, sir.
#Person1#: Francis, you have done an outstanding work in the past six months. In view of your achievement, I trust you ' re now indispensable part of our company and you deserve an officer director title.\n#Person2#: I am so happy to know that I could make some contribution to our company.\n#Person1#: This title does not only give you a raising pay-check, but also increase responsibilities. Congratulations, and hope the best for you.\n#Person2#: Thank you, I will be doing my best.
#Person1#: John, I ' d like you to meet Charles Brown, our new manager at the airport.\n#Person2#: Yes, certainly. How can I recognize him?\n#Person1#: He is short, well-built, and he ' s got light blond hair.\n#Person2#: Is there anything else?\n#Person1#: He has a mustache, if I remember correctly, and a light complexion.\n#Person2#: How old is he?\n#Person1#: He is in his late thirties.\n#Person2#: Well. I shouldn ' t have any trouble recognizing him. What time does his flight arrive?\n#Person1#: At 2 thirty.
#Person1#: Can you tell that I ' m excited?\n#Person2#: What are you excited about?\n#Person1#: I voted today.\n#Person2#: Was this your first time?\n#Person1#: I just turned 18 a month ago.\n#Person2#: You ' re lucky.\n#Person1#: What do you mean?\n#Person2#: Because you turned 18 in an election year.\n#Person1#: I didn ' t even think of that.\n#Person2#: You didn ' t?\n#Person1#: I really didn ' t, but I ' m still excited.\n#Person2#: You should be, because you ' re a part of history.
#Person1#: Hello. Can you tell me what the procedures of applying for a job are?\n#Person2#: Yes, of course. There are many steps. You can apply for the job on the Internet and then send your resume to the e-mail address of the company. And wail the feedback of the company.\n#Person1#: What is the qualification needed by the position?\n#Person2#: You must have over 2 years'experience first.
#Person1#: Can I still catch T107 for Xiamen?\n#Person2#: Sorry, sir. The train has already left.\n#Person1#: That's too bad. Can I take another train?\n#Person2#: Yes. Your ticket is valid for three days.\n#Person1#: That's great! I will take the next train.\n#Person2#: You have to have your ticket checked.\n#Person1#: Shall I pay extra charge?\n#Person2#: No extra charge at all. But your berth will be invalid.
#Person1#: From the looks of this house from the outside, I don't really think that I want to go inside.\n#Person2#: From here, it does look like it could use a little work. Let's see what the interior looks like.\n#Person1#: I am not impressed by the interior of this house.\n#Person2#: Sometimes all a place needs is a little bit of cleaning and some fresh paint.\n#Person1#: With so few windows, how can you even see what the problems are?\n#Person2#: I think that we should check out the kitchen. It is listed as roomy and spacious.\n#Person1#: Where are you supposed to store things without any cabinet space?\n#Person2#: The picture in the listing shows a lovely master suite. I think that we should go look at it since we are here.\n#Person1#: Is there a dead animal somewhere in here?\n#Person2#: Well, I think that it is pretty safe to say that this is not the house for you.
#Person1#: I've heard that you are going to call for a tender. What kind of goods would you like to buy?\n#Person2#: Yes, we're ready to start the invitation to tender. You're well informed. We'd like to build new factory.\n#Person1#: When do you open the tender? And where?\n#Person2#: We intend to open the tender at first next month in Beijing.\n#Person1#: And when is the closing date?\n#Person2#: The time period is set on June 29th.\n#Person1#: Could you please tell me something more about the conditions for the tender?\n#Person2#: All right. The area of the factory buildings is around 8, 000 square meters. You can read the details in the invitations which will be sent tomorrow.\n#Person1#: Thank you for your information.\n#Person2#: You're welcome.\n#Person1#: I'm sorry to have taken up too much of your time.\n#Person2#: It doesn't matter. We'll be in touch.\n#Person1#: Okay, bye!\n#Person2#: Bye!
#Person1#: Hello. I am calling about the apartment you advertised.\n#Person2#: Yes, what kind of apartment are you interested in?\n#Person1#: I am interested in one-bedroom. Do you have any available?\n#Person2#: Yes, I have one. When you need it?\n#Person1#: Sometime around next week. What can you tell me about this apartment?\n#Person2#: Well, It's a one-bedroom apartment. The monthly rent at 650 dollars and a 300 dollars security deposit. You pay electricity only. Gas and water is included. Both the heat and stove are gas. Let me see, what else. . . Oh, you'll be assigned a sheltered parking space at no extra charge. And that's probably it.\n#Person1#: Sounds good. May I come over tomorrow to take a look?\n#Person2#: Sure. What time would you like to come?\n#Person1#: How about 10 am?\n#Person2#: Good, May I have your name, please?\n#Person1#: My name is Blanca.\n#Person2#: Thanks for calling, Blanca. I'll see you tomorrow.
#Person1#: Nice to see you ; how have you been feeling lately?\n#Person2#: I have been feeling great, Dr. Smith.\n#Person1#: I am happy that you have decided to come in for your annual physical.\n#Person2#: Yes, I am going on a cross-country bike ride on vacation and want to make sure that I don't have any problems.\n#Person1#: We are going to look at your heart and lungs, do a few blood tests, and see that your eyes, ears, and nose are all working as they should.\n#Person2#: I'Ve been having trouble with congestion in my chest. Can you give me some tests for that?\n#Person1#: I can do a chest X-ray to check for congestion.\n#Person2#: That would be great. What is the blood test for?\n#Person1#: The blood test is for cholesterol, white blood cell count, and blood sugar.\n#Person2#: I have been feeling great. I don't imagine that any of my tests will turn out badly.
#Person1#: Some of them seem to be of the latest style. Now I'Ve a feeling that we can do a lot of trade in this line. We wish to establish relations with you.\n#Person2#: Your desire coincides with ours.\n#Person1#: Concerning our financial position, credit standing and trade reputation, you may refer to Bank of Hong Kong, or to our local Chamber of Commerce or inquiry agencies.\n#Person2#: Thank you for your information. As you know, our corporation is a state-operated one. We always trade with foreign countries on the basis of equality and mu - dual benefit. Establishing business relations between us will be to our mutual benefit. I have no doubt that it will bring about closer ties between us.\n#Person1#: That sounds interesting. I'll send a fax home. As soon as I receive a definite answer, I'll make a specific inquiry.\n#Person2#: We'll then make an offer as soon as possible. I hope a lot of business will be conducted between us.\n#Person1#: So do I.
#Person1#: So, how's your work?\n#Person2#: Good. How about you?\n#Person1#: I am going to resign. A few of the new staff have already left. Obviously, a lot of similar jobs pay much better salaries.\n#Person2#: But your company is huge. Can't they afford to pay the staff decent wages.\n#Person1#: But we have a policy of paying according to seniority in the company, so new employees get quite low salary, no matter how excellent they have done.\n#Person2#: That's shortsighted. By the time the workers are experienced and contributing. They are likely to go.\n#Person1#: That's why I am going to leave.\n#Person2#: But you have already worked there for five years.\n#Person1#: I am worried about my future. I can't believe that our company is as big as it is. The company can only continue to grow by taking care of its staff.\n#Person2#: Well. The management doesn't seem to think that way. Anyways, you have to think twice before you act.\n#Person1#: Thank you. I will.
#Person1#: You'd better prepare for the examination.\n#Person2#: I don't think the exam will be very hard.\n#Person1#: You should change your attitude, or you will not pass the course.\n#Person2#: Maybe you're right. I have been too lazy lately.
#Person1#: How about you, Chuck? Where did you grow up?\n#Person2#: Well, I was born in Ohio, but I grew up in Texas.\n#Person1#: And when did you come to Los Angeles?\n#Person2#: In 1978. I went to college here.\n#Person1#: Oh. What was your major?\n#Person2#: Drama. I was an actor for five years after college.\n#Person1#: That's interesting. So why did you become a hairdresser?\n#Person2#: Because I needed the money. And because I was good at it. Look! What do you think?
#Person1#: John, I'd like you to meet Charles Brown, our new manager at the airport.\n#Person2#: Yes, certainly. How can I recognize him?\n#Person1#: He is short, well-built, and he's got light blond hair.\n#Person2#: Is there anything else?\n#Person1#: He has a mustache, if I remember correctly, and a light complexion.\n#Person2#: How old is he?\n#Person1#: He is in his late thirties.\n#Person2#: Well. I shouldn't have any trouble recognizing him. What time does his flight arrive?\n#Person1#: At two thirty.
#Person1#: Hey! Fred, you are five minutes earlier than me today. Usually, you don't.\n#Person2#: Hurry! It is time for me to steal something.\n#Person1#: What's your meaning?\n#Person2#: I am stealing vegetables at the Happy Farm.\n#Person1#: You are a thief?\n#Person2#: No, no. I mean stealing vegetables on Internet is very popular now. Many white collars join in this game and have a lot of fun by stealing others'vegetables.\n#Person1#: You mean it is a still virtual game. Your friends steal your vegetables time and time again, and you take theirs as well, right?\n#Person2#: You got what I meant. Perhaps, what I steal are not vegetables, but loneliness.\n#Person1#: Don't be addicted to the game. It's not good for your job.
#Person1#: Herman, why are you so excited?\n#Person2#: I have met a beautiful girl.\n#Person1#: Have you fallen in love?\n#Person2#: Yes. At first sight.\n#Person1#: Can you describe the situation at that time?\n#Person2#: At that time her back was ramrod straight as she sailed by, her tone is best, neither over-passionate, nor too cold.\n#Person1#: What's her outlook?\n#Person2#: She was pretty, her hair was the color of rich dark chocolate, waving gently to her shoulders. Her complexion was clear and golden.
#Person1#: David, do you think which team will get the champion tonight?\n#Person2#: It is hard to guess now. Both of the teams chose the excellent players this time. I guess the game will end in a tie. They are equally matched.\n#Person1#: I am so nervous now. What a terrific game!\n#Person2#: Which side are you on?\n#Person1#: It's hard to say, because each team has my idols.\n#Person2#: Wow! AC wins. It is a close shave, you know.\n#Person1#: I will never forget this match. The angle is so terrible and so correct.\n#Person2#: What a good goal!
#Person1#: Mom, happy Mother's Day! A necklace for you.\n#Person2#: What a surprise! This is the best present I've ever received.\n#Person1#: Thank you for your love and care over the years. I love you so much.\n#Person2#: I love you, too.\n#Person1#: How about a dinner tonight? My treat.\n#Person2#: Actually, I prefer to eat at home, and then we'll have more time to have a chat.\n#Person1#: All right. Let me prepare the supper.
#Person1#: You seem to like her very much, don't you?\n#Person2#: I can't deny that. She is so beautiful that I fell in love with her at the first sight. I wish I knew more about her.\n#Person1#: But I heard that she had a three-year-old girl.\n#Person2#: I cannot belive that. It must be cooked up by someone.
#Person1#: Lucy, you're back. How was your first day of school?\n#Person2#: It was great. I had a really good time.\n#Person1#: What classes did you have?\n#Person2#: Well, I had English from 9 o'clock to 11 o'clock, art from 12 o'clock to 2 o'clock, and math from 2 o'clock to 4 o'clock.\n#Person1#: What do you think about the teachers?\n#Person2#: To be honest, I liked all of them, except for the math teacher. Though he must be quite young, he seem like an old person. He's so boring!\n#Person1#: That's too bad. How was your English teacher?\n#Person2#: She was great. In today's class, she gave us a lecture on how to be a good student. She told us not to arm for exams, and to pay more attention on communicating than memorizing.\n#Person1#: Where is she from?\n#Person2#: She said that she's from a small town in the middle of America.\n#Person1#: Were you able to understand everything that she said?\n#Person2#: Not everything, but nearly. She speaks very clearly and doesn't use very complex words so that it is easy for us to understand her.\n#Person1#: She sounds like a good teacher. Do you think you'll pass her class?\n#Person2#: Yes. . . with flying colors!\n#Person1#: What does that mean?\n#Person2#: It's a new phrase that she taught us today. It means that I will not only pass the class, but I will do extremely well!\n#Person1#: If you like the class this much already, I'm sure you will.\n#Person2#: I hope so.\n#Person1#: did she give you any homework?\n#Person2#: not today. She said she wanted us to relax tonight instead of doing homework,\n#Person1#: no wonder you like the class so much.
#Person1#: Where did you go yesterday?\n#Person2#: I went to play tennis in the public park.\n#Person1#: How often do you play tennis?\n#Person2#: Twice a week. How about you?\n#Person1#: I seldom play tennis. I prefer football and basketball.\n#Person2#: But it is very difficult to gather a team of players together.\n#Person1#: I usually play with my schoolmates.\n#Person2#: Do you like watching football matches?\n#Person1#: Yes, I went to the Than He Sports Center for a football match last Sunday.\n#Person2#: Oh, I watched it on television. It was an exciting match.
#Person1#: Hi. I'm looking for some good deals on produce.\n#Person2#: You might want to try the mangoes.\n#Person1#: Can you describe a mango to me?\n#Person2#: It's a fruit a little smaller than a grapefruit. It has a big seed in it.\n#Person1#: Do I eat the seed?\n#Person2#: Maybe some animals eat the seed, but humans don't. You'd have to soak it for 10 years.\n#Person1#: What's the price of these mangoes?\n#Person2#: Today you get a 50 - percent discount. They're only $ 1 each.\n#Person1#: Tell me what they taste like.\n#Person2#: Their flesh is soft and juicy. It has a citrus taste. It's sweet.\n#Person1#: Do I need to buy them ripe, or will they ripen at home?\n#Person2#: Just press into it gently with your thumb. If it feels soft, it's ready to eat.\n#Person1#: Where do mangoes come from?\n#Person2#: These are from Guatemala, but we're going to start getting mangoes from India.
#Person1#: My name is Steven Smith and I'm calling to cancel my plane ticket.\n#Person2#: When was your reservation?\n#Person1#: It's 7 p. m. today.\n#Person2#: Would you mind telling me the reason?\n#Person1#: I need to continue to deal with my business. I haven't finished it yet.\n#Person2#: Oh, I see. Would you like me to reschedule you for another time?\n#Person1#: No. Thank you.\n#Person2#: But you have to pay the fee for refund.\n#Person1#: OK. I will pay it by my bank card.
#Person1#: My pal, you are so nervous recently. You don't need to be like that.\n#Person2#: I am worried about that Arden will display all my drawbacks in the performance review. That will be embarrassing.\n#Person1#: Just use your head. If you were definitely making some big mistakes, you would be informed.\n#Person2#: I had a nightmare last night and I dreamt Arden told me that my performance fell short of his expectation. I was terrified to wake up after hearing that.\n#Person1#: That is merely a dream. Remember, there is always room for us to have further improvement. I think we did the good job in the whole period.\n#Person2#: I know what you are talking about. The performance evaluation process starts from the day we're hired. There is no surprise during the actual review.
#Person1#: Excuse me, sir. I've made a tough decision and here is my resignation.\n#Person2#: I am sorry to hear that. Why do you want to quit?\n#Person1#: I'm sorry to bring up my resignation at this moment, but I've decided to study abroad.\n#Person2#: All right. Welcome back anytime.\n#Person1#: Thank you, sir. I'd like to say that I'Ve really enjoyed working with you. However, I think it's about time for me to leave.\n#Person2#: I am glad to work with you, too. Good luck!\n#Person1#: Thank you.
#Person1#: I called about that ad we saw in the paper.\n#Person2#: For the construction site manager?\n#Person1#: That's the one.\n#Person2#: What happened?\n#Person1#: You were right. It was from a headhunter. She wouldn't tell me anything without a contract.\n#Person2#: Well, no surprise there.\n#Person1#: No! Not at all. But, I did find out they have more than one position with different clients, so at least one would probably work.\n#Person2#: Great, so are you going to sign a contract with them?\n#Person1#: I'm going there tomorrow.\n#Person2#: Great. Good luck.
#Person1#: Congratulations, Vivian. You won the grand prize, again.\n#Person2#: Isn't it just great! I just knew I'd win!\n#Person1#: You did? How? Did you wear red underwear again this year?\n#Person2#: Not only that!\n#Person1#: Tell me! Tell me! What's your secret? !\n#Person2#: OK, OK. I'll whisper it to you, but you have to promise not to tell anyone!\n#Person1#: What? ! You did that? ? !!!
#Person1#: What's the plot of your new movie?\n#Person2#: It's a story about a policemen who is investigating a series of strange murders. I play the part of the detective. He has to catch the killer, but there's very little evidence. It's a psychological th\n#Person1#: Did you enjoy making the movie? We heard stories of disagreement with other actors and with the director.\n#Person2#: I have had disagreement with every director. I'Ve worked with. We'Ve always disagreed in a friendly way and we have always resolved our differences. It was the same when I made this movie. I don't no\n#Person1#: Critics are not very happy with the movies that you'Ve made recently. Does that bother you?\n#Person2#: Not at all. The feedback from audience has been great. I care about what they think more than what the critics think.\n#Person1#: Did you do you own stunts in the movie?\n#Person2#: I wanted to, but my insurance company wouldn't let me. All of my stunts were done by a stuntman. As you know, I used to do my own stunts, but I'll leave that to the experts in future.\n#Person1#: Thank you very much for doing this interview.\n#Person2#: My pleasure. Have you seen the movie yet?\n#Person1#: Yes. I have. I liked it very much. Like you, I was very impressed with Rachel's performance in the movie. She's going to be a star.
#Person1#: Look at this. This magazine has some guidelines for having a healthy diet.\n#Person2#: When you have finished it, I'd like to see that. I've been thinking about what I am eating recently. I want to get some more ideas about nutrition and good health.\n#Person1#: I've noticed that you aren't eating much junk food and are avoiding food with too much fat. I know this diet is healthy, but...\n#Person2#: What are you thinking? Isn't this diet very tasty or satisfying?\n#Person1#: No, I don't think it's tasty but I know it is important to have healthy food to keep fit.\n#Person2#: Following the principles of good nutrition will help us to be healthy and enjoy a better life.\n#Person1#: But sometimes I'd like to enjoy a piece of rich cheesecake.\n#Person2#: Having one serving of cheesecake once in a while is not a problem. We just can't have too much and too often.
#Person1#: Hi, Mason!\n#Person1#: Oh, hi, Phoebe!\n#Person2#: Hey, in class today I heard you have a big family.\n#Person1#: That's right. I've got five brothers and six sisters.\n#Person2#: Wow! That's pretty big! Are you the eldest or the youngest?\n#Person1#: Neither. I'm the third eldest.
#Person1#: Hello, 6632278.\n#Person2#: Hi, Jack. It's me, Ann. I wasn't at school today. Have we got any homework to do for tomorrow?\n#Person1#: Let me see. Well, we've got to do the math problems on Page 40 in our textbook.\n#Person2#: All right. I've got it.\n#Person1#: Then, we have to go on with our reading for English. The history teacher wants us to read the chapter on the History of London for tomorrow, and write down the most important dates and events in that chapter.\n#Person2#: Anything else? Ah...ah, music?\n#Person1#: No, we haven't any music homework, but the science teacher is giving us a test on Friday, so we have to study for that.\n#Person2#: Oh no. I'm so bad at science. I hate it. Thanks, Jack.\n#Person1#: Don't mention it. See you tomorrow.
#Person1#: Welcome to Wanda International Cinema. Can I help you?\n#Person2#: Umm... I want to know when 'Operation Red Sea' is showing today.\n#Person1#: There are 6 showings today, one in the morning, another at noon, and then 3 p.m., 6 p.m., 9 p. m., and a midnight showing.\n#Person2#: OK, I want 5 tickets for the 9 p.m. showing tonight. Are there still 5 tickets available that are seated together?\n#Person1#: I'm sorry, there are only 3 tickets left. How about the 6 p.m. showing? There are still 7 tickets left for that show.\n#Person2#: But we have a date for dinner at 5 p.m., so we won't make the beginning of the movie.\n#Person1#: So would you like to see another movie? 'Detective China Town 2' is very popular, too.\n#Person2#: No, we all want to see this one. Is there any way that we could buy tickets now for Friday's screens?\n#Person1#: You can order tickets right now for the next three days. It's Wednesday today. So, that's OK. What time would you like?\n#Person2#: The 9 p.m. showing. I think there might be more people who want to see the movie on Friday. How many tickets can I buy at one time?\n#Person1#: The limit for advanced tickets is 10.\n#Person2#: OK, I'll have 8 tickets for the showing of 'Operation Red Sea'. Are the tickets available?\n#Person1#: Yes, you're lucky.\n#Person2#: By the way, when can I pick up the tickets?\n#Person1#: You can have them right now if you pay for them.\n#Person2#: Great! Thanks!
#Person1#: Hi, David! Mr. Harper has just asked me if you'd finished your project yet. It was supposed to be handed in yesterday.\n#Person2#: I know. I'm just finishing it now.\n#Person1#: He wanted to know if we'd done them together. I said no. What's yours on? It took me ages to do mine.\n#Person2#: Well, I was really lucky. I found this book all about the population in New Zealand cities.\n#Person1#: Is it good?\n#Person2#: Yes, it's a great book! I photocopied three chapters. There are some brilliant charts and...\n#Person1#: What are you going to do with all that?\n#Person2#: Well, now I'm going to copy these pages and these charts and then I'll finish my project!\n#Person1#: You're not supposed to just copy the book.\n#Person2#: Oh! I think Mr. Harper won't know.\n#Person1#: He will know! He asked us to write a list of all the books we'd used. Remember? That's not the point anyway.\n#Person2#: What is the point then?\n#Person1#: Well, the point is that you're supposed to write your own project--you can't copy someone else's writing.\n#Person2#: Er... er... Well, you're right. Thank you for your reminding me of that.
#Person1#: Today on mind matters, I'm talking to Dr. Ann Winters, an expert on human memory.. Ann, welcome to the program. Now, I suppose the first question everyone would ask is: what exactly is human memory?\n#Person2#: Well, like so many easy questions, the answer isn't very simple. Basically, human memory is a compartment in people's brains where they store images rather like the hard disc drive in a computer. And like a hard disc drive, our memories can become infected or even wiped out by accidents. But the comparison breaks down when we consider that we can train our memories to expand and work better which computers can't manage yet.\n#Person1#: When you talk about memory being infected, do you mean by a disease?\n#Person2#: Yes. For instance, people suffering from a physiological disease like Alzheimer: forget things that happened in the past. And they also forget how to perform simple tasks like tying their shoelaces. The good news is that brain exercises can help keep the brain young. Research has shown that people who have better educations and more mentally active jobs have a lower risk of developing the disease.\n#Person1#: And how can someone exercise his brain? By thinking a lot?\n#Person2#: In a way, yes. But you can also practice using your memory which not only exercises your brain but also improves you ability to remember things. Unfortunately, a lot of devices in modern life are designed to make sure we don't forget things which can make our brains more idle and weaken our memories.\n#Person1#: Can you give us some examples of how to exercise our memories?\n#Person2#: Sure, there is a very simple technique, although it works better for some people than for others. When you want to remember something, think of a physical thing it reminds you of. If I want to remember a date from history, let's say, 1066, the date of the Battle of Hastings. I might think that battle reminds me of bottle, so I think of a bottle with the number 1066 written on the label. And I just picture that bottle to myself.
#Person1#: We really were lucky. We got the last available table for two---and we didn't even have a reservation! Did you see the long lines behind us? \n#Person2#: Yeah, I'm glad that we didn't have to wait long. I'm starving! \n#Person1#: Let's take a look at the menu so we can order. Do you want to choose an appetizer for us to share? \n#Person2#: What would you rather have, samosas or poppadoms? \n#Person1#: I heard that one of their specialities is the samosa. \n#Person2#: Well, let's get a plate of those then. \n#Person1#: Sounds good. What are you going to have for your main course? \n#Person2#: I think I might have a dahl. \n#Person1#: What's in a dahl? \n#Person2#: It's got chickpeas and vegetables in a spicy curry sauce with rice. \n#Person1#: That sounds nice. Do you want to share some kebabs as well? \n#Person2#: Ok. How about some lamb kebabs? \n#Person1#: That's my favourite. Do you want to have some wine or beer? \n#Person2#: I think I'll have a beer. \n#Person1#: Ok, shall I flag down the waitress? \n#Person2#: I wouldn't recommend it. I think we should wait until she comes round. \n#Person1#: You're right. That might seem a bit rude. It's a good thing I've got you with me! \n#Person2#: What would you do without me? 
#Person1#: I've heard The Hitchhiker would be on next week. I want to see it. \n#Person2#: Is it horror movie? \n#Person1#: Yeah, I love horror movies the most. Would you like to go with me next weekend? \n#Person2#: No way. I will be scared out of my wits. \n#Person1#: Well, What kind of movies do you like? \n#Person2#: Er, let me see. Romance, comedy, documentary, action, science fiction, cartoon and so on. \n#Person1#: In a word, you like all the movies except for the horror movies. \n#Person2#: Yeah, It seems like we don't talk the same language as far as movies are concerned. \n#Person1#: Not quite. I also like romance and comedy movies very much. \n#Person2#: The Terminal is a movie of this type. \n#Person1#: So we can relax now. \n#Person2#: Yeah, I could hardly wait to see it. 
#Person1#: Do Mona and Jim need a new house? \n#Person2#: No, they have a big new fancy house. \n#Person1#: Does Jim make a lot of money? \n#Person2#: Yes, he does. He is a science fiction writer. \n#Person1#: Does Jim need to make more money? \n#Person2#: Afraid so. The more the better. \n#Person1#: What do they need all that money for? \n#Person2#: Well, they spend it pretty quick. New clothes, new computers and new cars every year. And they've got a cook and housekeeper. Mona used to be an actress, she likes to spend a lot of money. \n#Person1#: Do they have any children? \n#Person2#: No. They want children but no luck yet. \n#Person1#: What does Jim like to do? \n#Person2#: Jim likes to travel around the world. That's expensive! So he tries to make a lot of money. \n#Person1#: What does Mona like to do? \n#Person2#: Oh, she enjoys spending money on fancy parties. Mona loves to wear sexy dresses, and she has quite a bit of jewelry. \n#Person1#: Wow. . . She sounds like a high maintenance wife. \n#Person2#: I guess so. She is also interested in politics. She knows everyone in city government. \n#Person1#: Politics can be an expensive hobby. \n#Person2#: She is pretty serious about it. Her uncle is a mayor. She wants to follow in his footsteps. \n#Person1#: Politics is a hard game to play. \n#Person2#: She might do well. Everyone seems to like her. 
#Person1#: I really like the record you lent me the other day. \n#Person2#: I'm glad you like it. \n#Person1#: And thank you very much for letting me keep it so long. \n#Person2#: Not at all. \n#Person1#: I'm most grateful. Everyone in our class enjoyed it. \n#Person2#: I'm glad. \n#Person1#: Would you mind my keeping it for another week? 
#Person1#: You haven't spent much time with Sophia lately. Are you speaking to each other at the moment? \n#Person2#: No, we're not. We've been drifting apart for a while. \n#Person1#: But you two used to do everything together. I thought you really enjoyed each other's company. \n#Person2#: We did, but since she started her new job, all she does is hang out with her new friends from work. \n#Person1#: Can't you hang out with them, too? \n#Person2#: I could, but all they ever talk about is work, so I always end up feeling left out. \n#Person1#: Maybe you should invite her over for dinner, so it's just the two of you. \n#Person2#: I tried that a few weeks ago and she ended bringing a pal from work with her! She's so busy these days that it's just impossible to hang out with her. \n#Person1#: It can't be that bad. She was always a really good friend to you. \n#Person2#: You're right. She would never talk about me behind my back or hold a grudge. But she just doesn't seem very interested in our friendship anymore. \n#Person1#: She's probably just excited about her new job. You should give her some time. It would be a shame to lose such a good friend. \n#Person2#: I've given her enough time. I'm over it now. \n#Person1#: I still think you two should try to patch things up. \n#Person2#: I think I just have to accept the fact that it's time for us to go our separate ways. 
#Person1#: My wife's birthday is today. I need some flowers. \n#Person2#: We have lots of fresh red roses. \n#Person1#: How much do the roses cost? \n#Person2#: $20 a dozen. \n#Person1#: That sounds good. Last year I paid $30. \n#Person2#: Yes, you came here on the right day. They're on sale today. \n#Person1#: Give me a dozen. \n#Person2#: Very good. Would you like anything else? \n#Person1#: No, I'll just give her the roses and a card. \n#Person2#: She should be very pleased with these roses. 
#Person1#: I'm about to run out of business cards. I need some new ones. \n#Person2#: We can print as many as you like. Just tell me how many. \n#Person1#: Two thousand should get me through the year. \n#Person2#: Here's a form to get you started. \n#Person1#: My old card is perfect, so all I want you to do is copy it exactly. \n#Person2#: I think you'll be very pleased with how well we duplicate your old card. \n#Person1#: . . . Here you go \n#Person2#: Thanks. Come back here next Wednesday to pick up your order, please. \n#Person1#: I'm sorry, but can you give me a three-day turnaround? \n#Person2#: If you don't mind paying a little extra, it's absolutely no problem. \n#Person3#: \n#Person1#: I'm about to run out of business cards. I need some new ones. \n#Person2#: We can print as many as you like. Just tell me how many. \n#Person1#: Two thousand should get me through the year. \n#Person2#: Here's a form to get you started. \n#Person1#: My old card is perfect, so all I want you to do is copy it exactly. \n#Person2#: I think you'll be very pleased with how well we duplicate your old card. \n#Person1#: . . . Here you go \n#Person2#: Thanks. Come back here next Wednesday to pick up your order, please. \n#Person1#: I'm sorry, but can you give me a three-day turnaround? \n#Person2#: If you don't mind paying a little extra, it's absolutely no problem. 
#Person1#: Excuse me, sir. Could you spare a minute? \n#Person2#: Uh, yes. \n#Person1#: Do you go to work by train every day? \n#Person2#: Yes. I commute five days a week by train. \n#Person1#: And would you mind telling us what you think of the rail service? \n#Person2#: It's really very good. \n#Person1#: Why do you say that? \n#Person2#: Well, trains are frequent and come on time. \n#Person1#: Which train do you catch in the evening? \n#Person2#: I usually take the 5 thirty home. \n#Person1#: And can you get a seat? \n#Person2#: No, I usually have to stand. \n#Person1#: Would you agree that the service is fast? \n#Person2#: Yes, it's reasonably fast but it certainly isn't cheap. Fares have gone up25%. 
#Person1#: Would you like some tea or coffee?\n#Person2#: No, thank you. It's very late now. I won't be able to sleep well if I drink some tea or coffee.\n#Person1#: Then what about some water?\n#Person2#: Yes, please.\n#Person1#: Don't work too late since you are not in good health. You should be careful with your health.\n#Person2#: I know, but I have to finish these reports tonight. Our manager will use them at the meeting tomorrow morning.\n#Person1#: Can I help you with something?\n#Person2#: No, I'm afraid you can't. Just turn down the TV set a little so that it won't be so noisy.\n#Person1#: I will. I do hope that you will finish the report soon and get some sleep.\n#Person2#: Don't worry. It won't take me too long.
#Person1#: Have you ever been to the Hard Rock Cafe?\n#Person2#: No. What is it?\n#Person1#: It's a rock and roll themed restaurant, but some locations are also hotels. It's a chain so cities all over the world have them. There is one in San Francisco. I was thinking about checking it out. Would you like to join me?\n#Person2#: Sure, that sounds fun.\n#Person1#: The original cafe was founded in London in 1971. But since 2007, the headquarters has been in Florida. It didn't start to expand worldwide until 1982 and the one San Francisco opened in 1984.\n#Person2#: Interesting. Actually come to think of it, I think I passed by one when I was traveling in is Stumble Turkey. Wow, I guess they really are all over the world.\n#Person1#: Yes, it's a very international chain. I was reading about it and apparently there are 191 locations all over the world in 59 different countries.\n#Person2#: Wow, that's amazing.\n#Person1#: Maybe we can go this weekend.\n#Person2#: I'm working this weekend, but I get my schedule for the following week tomorrow. I should probably have a few days free next week.\n#Person1#: OK. Sounds good. I'll call and see if I can make a reservation. Just give me a call when you know your schedule.
#Person1#: Merry Christmas!\n#Person2#: Thank you. The same to you.\n#Person1#: Do you have any plans?\n#Person2#: I have been invited to a friend's party, but I want to go to my uncle's. And you?\n#Person1#: My roommate is having a party. I'll go there.\n#Person2#: Great! Watching TV or sleeping at home is really boring.\n#Person1#: Yes. Did you know that there would be a school sports meet next week?\n#Person2#: Really? I had no idea. I like watching the track and field events. They're really exciting.\n#Person1#: They're just so so, I think. Anyway, have a nice holiday.\n#Person2#: Thank you. And enjoy the party.
#Person1#: How is travel in the 1960s different from that of the early 1900s dad?\n#Person2#: Well in the 1960s people rode in cars over wide roads. They flew in planes from Europe to America in a few hours.\n#Person1#: What about the 1900s?\n#Person2#: In the early 1900s planes were very new, to see one was so unusual that people of a town stopped what they were doing to watch it flying overhead.\n#Person1#: But today, it is quite different isn't it?\n#Person2#: Yes, today you were able to travel to many places in a few hours because of the development of the plane. You turn on electric lights because someone invented ways to make use of electricity, you are part of history.\n#Person1#: Is our life also changed by history?\n#Person2#: That's right. The history made by people before you were born has changed your life.\n#Person1#: I see thank you dad.
#Person1#: Hi Vanessa, did you have a good weekend?\n#Person2#: Oh yes, it was great. I went to see a special James Bond exhibition at the Science Museum.\n#Person1#: Sounds interesting. Though aren't museums a bit expensive? By paid $8 last time I went.\n#Person2#: This was only 650. I did buy a guidebook as well. That was an extra 295.\n#Person1#: How did you get there?\n#Person2#: You can take the underground but I went by bus. It stops just outside, I got very tired walking around the museum, though.\n#Person1#: What did you see?\n#Person2#: James Bond's plane, which was my favorite, and the tiny Camera and his car, things like that.\n#Person1#: These sounds great. How early can you go in, at 9:00?\n#Person2#: Not until 10 and we didn't get there until 11:30, so there wasn't enough time to see everything.\n#Person1#: Can you eat there?\n#Person2#: Yes. You can even take a picnic. I had a sandwich at the cafe. But you can get a hot meal at the restaurant.\n#Person1#: I'd really like to go. On free next Saturday, that's the twenty-thirdth of April.\n#Person2#: The exhibitions on until the twenty-seventh, so the Saturday may be busy.\n#Person1#: Well, I'll go on the twenty-fourth then.
#Person1#: What about giving us more money?\n#Person2#: I'm sorry. But the local government doesn't have anymore money for the zoo.\n#Person1#: But if we don't find a solution soon, we'll have to close it. And the zoo was part of the city. It's a tourist attraction.\n#Person2#: Yes, but that's the point. It simply isn't attracting enough tourists. You're going to have to find the money from somewhere else.\n#Person1#: But it's also an important place for animal conservation. Some of these animals are endangered. If we didn't have zoos, they wouldn't survive.\n#Person2#: I understand that, but we need to find a different solution. What if you advertised the zoo? In the newspaper or on the radio, for example.\n#Person1#: But if we don't have any money, we can't advertise.\n#Person2#: Well, why don't you try some other way? You know, ask a company to support the zoo.\n#Person1#: Actually, that isn't a bad idea. You might be right.\n#Person2#: I have the names of some company bosses you could try to get in touch with.
#Person1#: Put on the helmet, please.\n#Person2#: Do we need to put on the jackets too?\n#Person1#: You ' d better, to protect your clothes. Now please watch your step.\n#Person2#: Thank you. Is the production line fully automated?\n#Person1#: Well, not fully automated.\n#Person2#: I see. How do you control the quality?\n#Person1#: All products have to go through five checks in the whole manufacturing process.\n#Person2#: What ' s the monthly output?\n#Person1#: One thousand units per month now. But we ' ll be making 1, 200 units beginning with October.\n#Person2#: What ' s your usual percentage of rejects?\n#Person1#: About 2 % in normal operations.\n#Person2#: That ' s wonderful. Is that where the finished products come off?\n#Person1#: Yes. Shall we take a break now?
#Person1#: I'm here to conduct the annual census of foreigners living in Beijing. This is my service ID card.\n#Person2#: OK. What do you want to know?\n#Person1#: We only need to verify your information against our records.\n#Person2#: OK.\n#Person1#: Please show me your passport and Residence Permit.\n#Person2#: Here you are.\n#Person1#: How long have you been living here?\n#Person2#: Two years.\n#Person1#: May I know your occupation?\n#Person2#: I'm a professor at a university.\n#Person1#: Is that right? Which university, if you don't mind my asking?\n#Person2#: I teach at Beijing Normal University, English composition and some conversational classes.\n#Person1#: Everything appears to be in order. Thank you for your time.
#Person1#: Do you have anything to do after this?\n#Person2#: No, I don't.\n#Person1#: Shall we drop in somewhere for a couple of drinks?\n#Person2#: That sounds like a good idea.\n#Person1#: I know a very interesting place.\n#Person2#: Oh, do you? Good.
#Person1#: Hey Eve, how are you?\n#Person2#: I'm fine, Celia. And you?\n#Person1#: I'm ok. I'm so busy!\n#Person2#: Do you have a lot of homework?\n#Person1#: Yes. Don't you?\n#Person2#: Of course I do!\n#Person1#: Which class are you working on right now?\n#Person2#: I'm studying for my chemistry exam tomorrow.\n#Person1#: Are you in Mrs. Green's class?\n#Person2#: Yes. Are you?\n#Person1#: Yes. We must have the same exam tomorrow!\n#Person2#: Do you want to study together?\n#Person1#: Sure. This library is too quiet though.\n#Person2#: Do you want to go to an empty classroom?\n#Person1#: That sounds good.\n#Person2#: OK. Let's go!
#Person1#: There is a wonderful opera today. I'd like to see it.\n#Person2#: I do not like the play with complicated plot. What's on today?\n#Person1#: 'The sound of music'. This music is known by everybody and is suitable for all ages. It is about a happy family without sex, violence or bad language.\n#Person2#: I know that. I have seen the film as the same title. Andrews gives a performance to be remembered for a lifetime from Maria to a cheerful governess.\n#Person1#: Yes, you are right. I like the song in the movie, edelweiss, do you remember it?\n#Person2#: Of course, it is a nice song that can make audience calm and pleasant.\n#Person1#: Those young actors play the roles perfectly.\n#Person2#: I hope the opera will be more stupendous than the movie. Have you bought the tickets?\n#Person1#: No, I am asking you whether you will go to see it.\n#Person2#: Let's go. We'd better buy the tickets earlier and have dinner in restaurant.
#Person1#: It's a beautiful day, isn't it?\n#Person2#: Yes, isn't it.\n#Person1#: Do you know the temperature today?\n#Person2#: It's beautiful 75 degrees.\n#Person1#: How nice. I hope the weather will stay like this for the whole week. I'm going on the canoe trip this weekend.\n#Person2#: Not a good plan. The TV weather forecast says the hurricane is coming this weekend, and the temperature will also drop to 66 degrees.\n#Person1#: What a nuisance! Every time I plan to go canoeing or camping, a storm comes along. The sky gets dark, the wind starts to howl and the temperature drops. Well, I'd better stay home.\n#Person2#: I never make any definite weekend plan until Friday morning. Then after listening to the weather temperature, I make my plans.\n#Person1#: That's smart. I'm going to start doing the same thing.
#Person1#: Hello, Mike, long time no see. How's everything going?\n#Person2#: Not bad. Thank you. You look great today. And how is your husband?\n#Person1#: He caught a cold yesterday, but he feels much better now.\n#Person2#: Well, I'm glad to hear that. Please give my regards to him.\n#Person1#: I sure will. Thanks.
#Person1#: what's your opinion about childless couples? Will you choose to have no kids?\n#Person2#: to be honest, I wouldn't.\n#Person1#: why? Do you have to make a choice now?\n#Person2#: not really. But it has puzzled me for a long time.\n#Person1#: what's the puzzle?\n#Person2#: my husband and I prefer to have no kids, but my mother-in-law is very traditional and wants grandkids.\n#Person1#: oh, I see. I think the older generation tend to think in a different way.\n#Person2#: yes. It seems she can never accept a childless marriage. We had a fight last night.\n#Person1#: oh, really? Maybe she is just eager to see her grandchildren.\n#Person2#: but it's absolutely our own business to have a child or not.\n#Person1#: definitely.\n#Person2#: you know, I often overhear our neighbor, the young couple, fighting about how to raise their kid and I really don't want kids to spoil our happiness.\n#Person1#: don't worry. I think in most cases, children are the glue that keeps a family together.\n#Person2#: I guess you're right. But I still prefer to have no child.\n#Person1#: sure. You can fully enjoy your time together.
#Person1#: Where are you going this weekend?\n#Person2#: I'm going to Hainan.\n#Person1#: Oh really? It'll be nice and warm there. Have you been there before?\n#Person2#: Yes, actually it's my second visit. I was there last October.\n#Person1#: I see. What's it like there?\n#Person2#: Well, the life style is much more relaxed than here in the city. And the seafood is tastier!\n#Person1#: Well, have a great time!
#Person1#: Who is it?\n#Person2#: Supervisor. Open the door.\n#Person1#: Wait a sec.\n#Person2#: What are you doing here?\n#Person1#: We're watching a football match. What's the matter?\n#Person2#: Your neighbors complained that you were so noisy that they can't sleep.\n#Person1#: I'm sorry about this.\n#Person2#: Please turn down the TV. And not another shout or I'll have to report you to the school administration.\n#Person1#: You can rest assured that we won't disturb others anymore.
#Person1#: Did you ever take History 231?\n#Person2#: Yeah. Last semester.\n#Person1#: Who was the professor?\n#Person2#: It was Professor Johnson.\n#Person1#: I have him this semester. What do you think about him?\n#Person2#: He's a terrible instructor and demands a lot, but fortunately, he's an easy grader.\n#Person1#: What did you end up getting?\n#Person2#: I got an A -. Sounds good, but none of my test scores were that high, so I don't know how I got a decent grade.\n#Person1#: That's probably because he grades on a curve.\n#Person2#: Are you enjoying the class so far?\n#Person1#: I hate it and I was about to withdrawal. But after hearing your experience, I think I will tough it out.\n#Person2#: Yes. Definitely stay in the class. You will get a better grade than your test scores. He does that deliberately to make all the students study a lot.\n#Person1#: Thanks for letting me know. I feel relieved now.
#Person1#: Waiter, bring me the menu, will you?\n#Person2#: Just a moment, I'm coming. ( ten minutes later ). Now, what would you like?\n#Person1#: I'd like to see the menu. Would you get me one, please?\n#Person2#: Yes, certainly. Here you are.\n#Person1#: Thank you. Ah! But this is in French. Would you mind giving me the English menu?\n#Person2#: It's written in English too, in smaller print. There.\n#Person1#: Thanks. I'll need a while to choose. Could you come back in a minute?\n#Person2#: Right. ( five minutes later ) Now, what are you having?\n#Person1#: I'm sorry, I haven't decided yet. Do you mind giving me a couple of minutes?\n#Person2#: All right, but would you be so kind as to make up your mind soon? We're very busy just now as you can see, sir.
#Person1#: You have any ideas as to what you want to do this weekend?\n#Person2#: I'm going to the movie theater with my friend. What are you going to do?\n#Person1#: I'm not quite sure yet.\n#Person2#: How about you see a movie with me and my friend?\n#Person1#: What movie are you and your friend planning on watching?\n#Person2#: Not sure. Is there a movie out that catches your eye?\n#Person1#: No good movies come to mind.\n#Person2#: Have you decided whether or not you would like to go?\n#Person1#: No, thanks. Maybe another time.\n#Person2#: For sure another day.
#Person1#: Can you believe her? She is not even a hundred pounds and she is going off on how she wants to go on a diet.\n#Person2#: Tell me about it. If I was as small as her, I wouldn't think about going on a diet.\n#Person1#: Me too. But what are we going to do? I have been on 4 different diets and I can't seem to lose weight.\n#Person2#: That's because you don't exercise. If you were more active, you wouldn't have a dieting problem.\n#Person1#: What do you know? You are over weight too.\n#Person2#: I'm not on a diet though.\n#Person1#: I know. But I don't have someone to diet with. If we help each other and motivate each other, then I think we can lose some weight.\n#Person2#: I like ice cream too much though.\n#Person1#: C'mon. You'll feel better and look better and as a reward you can eat a little bit of ice cream here and there.\n#Person2#: It does sound appealing.\n#Person1#: It's a great idea. I can't believe I didn't think of this earlier. Going on a diet with a friend to back you up is a great way to succeed.\n#Person2#: Okay. I'm in. Let's do it.\n#Person1#: Great. I'll get our plan started right away.\n#Person2#: Can we start tomorrow though?
#Person1#: Passport and Embarkation card please.\n#Person2#: Here you are, sir.\n#Person1#: Where are you from?\n#Person2#: I am from China.\n#Person1#: Did you have anything to declare?\n#Person2#: No, nothing.\n#Person1#: Would you open this suitcase, please?\n#Person2#: Sure.\n#Person1#: Let me take a look at this bag. Can you open it?\n#Person2#: Yup.\n#Person1#: Is this camera a gift for someone?\n#Person2#: No, it's my camera for personal use.\n#Person1#: You have to pay tax for this camera.\n#Person2#: No, please don't. It's is for my personal use.\n#Person1#: You have a lot of gifts, so you have to pay for the camera.\n#Person2#: Almost all are for my friends in the States.
#Person1#: What happens if we make a deal and thirty to sixty days after delivery the price goes down and you didn't get the best possible price? How do I handle that?\n#Person2#: Well, these things happens, I know that. You just have to stay straight with me.\n#Person1#: Right! So how do I do that? What will make you happy?\n#Person2#: Well, I suggest you just keep me posted. That should do it. That way the burden is on me to decide when to buy, not you.\n#Person1#: Excuse me?\n#Person2#: Yeah, it really is that simple. Every time there's a change in the items we do business on, you let me know. That's all you need to do.\n#Person1#: What kind of change, just in prices?\n#Person2#: No, any change. I want you to keep me as informed as you are. I need to know as much as you do. If you hear about something that might happen, then tell me about it. Tell me it's rumor, what it's based on and your opinion on how likely it is.\n#Person1#: You mean on product availability, reliability and price?\n#Person2#: No, everthing. Those things for sure, but also labor problems, raw materials, new subcontractors, mergers, in short, anything and everything. So I can make a fully informed decision.\n#Person1#: So it's like you want me to be your eyes and ears into the industry. I can do that, provided the company I'm working for isn't hurt.\n#Person2#: I think we'll get along fine.
#Person1#: Hello, may I speak to Mr. Robert the Human Resources Manager?\n#Person2#: Wait a minute. I will get him here. Sorry, he is busy doing something. Why don't you give him a ring later?\n#Person1#: OK, that's fine. Thank you.\n#Person2#: You are welcome.
#Person1#: Good morning, can I help you?\n#Person2#: Yes, I'd like to check out.\n#Person1#: Yes, of course sir. What's your name and your room number, PLS?\n#Person2#: Jack Remington, room 1408.\n#Person1#: Ok, here is your bill, Mr. Remington.\n#Person2#: Which of these is my bill?\n#Person1#: Oh, I am sorry sir. I forgot to explain that to you. This one is an allowance slip. We made a mistake in your bill and overcharged you 120 dollars. So we had to write up an allowance slip and deduct 120 dollars from your bill.\n#Person2#: I see. So this is the bill then and the total is. . . ?\n#Person1#: Down here, 800 dollars. How do you wish to settle your account, sir, in cash or by credit card?\n#Person2#: In cash.\n#Person1#: Is that US dollars?\n#Person2#: Yes.\n#Person1#: Just a moment, PLS. I'll write out a receipt for you.
#Person1#: Can I help you with something?\n#Person2#: I need to cancel one of my accounts.\n#Person1#: Is there a problem with it?\n#Person2#: I don't need it anymore.\n#Person1#: What would you like to do with all the money in this account?\n#Person2#: Just transfer it over to my remaining account.\n#Person1#: I can do that.\n#Person2#: That would be great.\n#Person1#: Do you want to take any money out?\n#Person2#: Not today.\n#Person1#: It's going to take a moment for me to cancel your account.\n#Person2#: That's fine. Take your time.
#Person1#: Hello, Steven. Annie said that you and Julia have had a quarrel, haven't you?\n#Person2#: That's true. We had an argument yesterday. She blamed me for not preparing the supper that day, but it was her turn to cook the dinner.\n#Person1#: That's the reason why you fought?\n#Person2#: Yes.\n#Person1#: You two are always quarrelling over little things.\n#Person2#: That wasn't my fault, but she said'you're a disgrace'to me. I'm about to explode!\n#Person1#: Are you still mad at her now?\n#Person2#: To be honest, I'm not, and I regret a little what I have done.\n#Person1#: Will you apologize to her?\n#Person2#: No way. It's her who should apologize.
#Person1#: How was your appraisal with the boss?\n#Person2#: Oh it was really good. Do you know, he's the nicest boss I'Ve had here.\n#Person1#: Yes, I think he's the most relaxed person in management.\n#Person2#: What's more, he said I was the hardest working person in the office!\n#Person1#: That's good. Maybe you'll get promoted.\n#Person2#: I hope so. Then I'll be the happiest person in our office too!
#Person1#: Can I help you?\n#Person2#: Thank you, but I'm just looking around. How much does this skirt cost?\n#Person1#: This is the new style. Two hundred and twenty-eight.\n#Person2#: May I try it on?\n#Person1#: Of course, please.\n#Person2#: Can you give me a better deal?\n#Person1#: Two hundred and ten yuan. It is the lowest price.\n#Person2#: Well, I'll give one hundred and eighty yuan for it.\n#Person1#: Well, two hundred yuan.\n#Person2#: No, this is my final offer.\n#Person1#: OK, I'll wrap it for you.
#Person1#: Dan, did you want to see me?\n#Person2#: Oh, yes, Sue, please sit down. We need some help.\n#Person1#: What can I do?\n#Person2#: Look at this schedule. There are four conferences in April. And there aren't enough representatives to cover all of them.\n#Person1#: But I am not on the executive staff.\n#Person2#: I know, but you have studied management and merchandising. And we have openings for more managerial people. There is a good opportunity for you here.\n#Person1#: That sounds wonderful. But what do you want me to do?\n#Person2#: There's a conference in Seattle on the 18th of April. I want you to represent us.\n#Person1#: That's a big responsibility.\n#Person2#: You'll do very well, and I'm pretty sure.\n#Person1#: Is there a lot to learn?\n#Person2#: There are a few things, but they aren't difficult.\n#Person1#: There isn't much time left. Can I start now?\n#Person2#: There are some reports on the previous conferences in the files. You can study those.\n#Person1#: Can you give me any guidelines about etiquette in other countries?\n#Person2#: There are several overall guidelines that apply to international conferences.\n#Person1#: Then where can I find all the country-specific information?\n#Person2#: Usually you can call that country's embassy or consulate. Most of them have printed materials for business visitors. And there are also travel books available at public libraries. If you don't have enough time, you can also ask Sally, as she attended the conference there last time.\n#Person1#: Great. And will our company arrange for transportation?\n#Person2#: Yes. Tell the travel department about what you think you'll need, and they can make arrangements for you.\n#Person1#: Thank you. I will give it my best shot.
#Person1#: So, how are things going, Steve?\n#Person2#: Well, to be honest Carla, I was feeling great on Saturday, but I started to feel sick Sunday afternoon. I thought I'd get better, but I feel worse than before. And I'm really worried because I'm scheduled to give a presentation at work on Friday, so I have to be better by then.\n#Person1#: Well, what seems to be the problem?\n#Person2#: Well, I thought I had the flu, but the doctor said it was just a bad cold. He gave me some cold medicine to take care of my stuffy nose and fever. I'm supposed to take the medicine three times a day after eating, but it doesn't seem to help. He also told me to stay off my feet for a day or so, but I'm so busy these days.\n#Person1#: Listen, forget about that medicine! I have just the thing to get rid of bad colds. You see, my mom is really into herbal medicine.\n#Person2#: Oh, no thanks.\n#Person1#: Ah, come on! Give it a try. You just take some of my mom's herbal tea and drink it four times a day. Believe me. You'll be up and dancing around in no time.\n#Person2#: Dancing around in no time, right? Well, I guess. Nothing else seems to be doing the job.\n#Person1#: Great. I'll come by your place at 7:30. See you then.
#Person1#: My camera has broken down. I'm thinking of buying a new one.\n#Person2#: Try MA-205. You won't regret it.\n#Person1#: I know this model is of a good quality and design but it's too expensive.\n#Person2#: You can buy a cheaper one on the Internet.\n#Person1#: On the Internet? How?\n#Person2#: Use a search engine and search for cheap MA-205.\n#Person1#: A search engine? Em, what's that?\n#Person2#: You really live in the stone age. All right, tell me your budget and I'll see whether I can get one for you.
#Person1#: Hello, Mrs. Taylor. Can you help me? I'm doing my homework and I can't understand this word.\n#Person2#: Which one? Oh, I can't help you right away...I'm watching something on TV.\n#Person1#: Oh? What are you watching?\n#Person2#: I'm watching a cowboy film.\n#Person1#: Can Mr. Taylor help me?\n#Person2#: No, he can't now, Paul. He's reading.\n#Person1#: What is he reading?\n#Person2#: He's reading a magazine.\n#Person1#: What about Kate?\n#Person2#: Oh, she can't help you either. She's making a phone call now.\n#Person1#: Oh? Who's she calling?\n#Person2#: She's calling her boyfriend.\n#Person1#: Then where is Jack? Can I ask for help from him?\n#Person2#: He hasn't been home yet...Why? You're asking a lot of questions tonight, Paul.\n#Person1#: Am I?...Well, I'm practicing my English.
#Person1#: You must have enjoyed using your new camera on your trip.\n#Person2#: I would have, but after buying a new camera especially for that trip, I left it in the car of my friend who drove me to the airport.
#Person1#: So, here we are, deep in the forest. With me is Dr. Green, can you tell us a little about this wonderful place?\n#Person2#: Yes, of course. As you can see, the forest is full of trees, birds and insects.\n#Person1#: Yes, there are strange and beautiful plants everywhere. How many different kinds of plants are there?\n#Person2#: Well, in just one square kilometer of the forest, you can find about 1,500 different kinds of plants and 750 different kinds of trees. And many of them don't grow in any other places of the world.\n#Person1#: Really? Now I'm sure the people listening to this program can hear this unbelievable noise of birds. What's making all the noise?\n#Person2#: Well, of course. The forest is full of living things. You can find about 400 different kinds of birds in just one square kilometer.\n#Person1#: Really? How interesting!
#Person1#: Hello!\n#Person2#: Hello, Mike! This is Jane.\n#Person1#: Oh. Hello, Jane!\n#Person2#: Listen, Mike! I've got a real problem.\n#Person1#: What is it?\n#Person2#: The car's broken down.\n#Person1#: Oh, not again.\n#Person2#: Yeah. I checked the oil and I checked almost everything. It's just not starting at all.\n#Person1#: You have to get rid of it, you know.\n#Person2#: I know, I know. But look, the thing is, I've got to pick Tom up at the airport. Can I......?\n#Person1#: Use my car? Yes, of course.\n#Person2#: That'll be great! It's very kind of you.\n#Person1#: Come on when you like. I don't need it till tonight.\n#Person2#: OK! I'll be around in about an hour. Thanks a lot!\n#Person1#: It's all right. See you then!\n#Person2#: See you!
#Person1#: Do you think I could borrow your car to go grocery shopping? The supermarkets outside the city are so much cheaper. I'd also be happy to pick up anything you need.\n#Person2#: Well, I don't like to let anyone else drive my car. Tell you what, why don't we go together?
#Person1#: Why don't you sit down? Now, there are several questions I must ask you if you don't mind.\n#Person2#: Not at all. Go ahead.\n#Person1#: What is the purpose of your visit to the States?\n#Person2#: I'm going to attend a conference on air pollution.\n#Person1#: When and where is this conference being held?\n#Person2#: It's being held in the first two weeks of February at the University of Stanford in California.\n#Person1#: Who will pay your expenses?\n#Person2#: The University of Stanford. Here is the official letter of invitation.\n#Person1#: I see. Fine. When do you want to go?\n#Person2#: I'd like to leave in mid-January if my passport is ready by then.\n#Person1#: That shouldn't be difficult. Why don't you phone me about January 10th? I should be able to give you an answer then.\n#Person2#: Thank you.
#Person1#: Excuse me, I'm sorry to bother you, but would you have time to answer a few questions?\n#Person2#: What's it about?\n#Person1#: We're doing some market research for a new television channel starting in two years' time.\n#Person2#: OK, why not?\n#Person1#: Lovely, we'll just work through this form. And if we could start with some personal background information.\n#Person2#: Sure.\n#Person1#: Right, if I could just have your age...\n#Person2#: 35.\n#Person1#: Right, great. And your job?\n#Person2#: Systems analyst, but for the form I don't know whether it would count as professional or business or what.\n#Person1#: What do you think?\n#Person2#: OK, it's more like business.\n#Person1#: Fine. And would you mind my asking about your salary? Or we can leave it blank.\n#Person2#: No, I don't mind. It's 40,000 a year.\n#Person1#: Thank you. Right... about your current watching habits..., what would you say is your main reason for watching TV?\n#Person2#: Well, at work I tend to read for information and what have you, so I'd say that with TV it probably just helps me relax and unwind.\n#Person1#: Fine. And how many hours a day on average do you watch TV?\n#Person2#: Not a lot really... I should say just over an hour.\n#Person1#: So what are the two main times of the day that you watch TV?\n#Person2#: Well, a little around breakfast time and then it tends to be really late eleven or even midnight- when I've finished work.\n#Person1#: And what sort of programmes do you go for?\n#Person2#: Some news bulletins but I also really like to put my feet up with some of the old comedy shows.\n#Person1#: Fine. And turning to the new channel..., which type of programmes would you like to see more of?\n#Person2#: Well, I certainly don't think we need any more factual programmes like news and documentaries. I think we need more about things like local information..., you know, providing a service for the community. And in the same vein, perhaps more for younger viewers..., you know, good quality stuff.\n#Person1#: Ah ha. And if you had to give the new directors some specific advice when they set up the channel, what advice would you give them?\n#Person2#: I think I'd advise them to pay a lot of attention to the quality of the actual broadcast, you know, the sound system. People are very fussy these days about that and in general I think they ought to do lots more of these kinds of interview, you know, talking with their potential customers.\n#Person1#: Oh, I'm glad you think it's valuable!\n#Person2#: Certainly... yeah.\n#Person1#: Good. OK, this will be a commercial channel of course, but how often do you think it is tolerable to have adverts?\n#Person2#: Well, out of that list I'd say every quarter of an hour. I don't think we can complain about that, as long as they don't last tot ten minutes each time!\n#Person1#: Quite. And would you be willing to attend any of our special promotions for the new channel?\n#Person2#: Yes, I'd be very happy to, as long as they're held here in my area.\n#Person1#: OK, I'll make a note of that. And finally, may we put you on our mailing list?\n#Person2#: Well, I'd prefer not..., except for the information about the promotion you mentioned.\n#Person1#: Can I have your name and address?\n#Person2#: Of course ... here's my card.\n#Person1#: Oh, lovely..., and thank you very much for your time and we look forward to seeing you.\n#Person2#: Yes, indeed. Urn, thanks.
#Person1#: Today in the studio we have Alberto Cortez, the well-known Brazilian advocate of the anti-global movement. He's here to talk about the recent report, stating that by 2050 Brazil will be the one ot the word's wealthiest and most successful countries. Alberto, what do you say to the report?\n#Person2#: You know this isn't the first time that people are saying Brazil will be a great economic power. The same thing was said over a hundred year ago. But it didn't happen.\n#Person1#: Yes, but you must admit the world's a very different place now.\n#Person2#: Of course. In fact I believe there's maybe some truth in the prediction this time around. First of all, though, we must remember the problems facing Brazil at the moment.\n#Person1#: Such as...?\n#Person2#: There's an enormous gap between the rich and the poor in this country. In Sal Paulo, you can see shopping malls full of designer goods right next door to the slam areas without proper water and electricity supplies. A lot of work needs to be done to help people in those areas improve their lives.\n#Person1#: What needs to be done?\n#Person2#: Education, for example. For Brazil to be successful, we need to offer education to all Brazilians. Successful countries like South Korea and Singapore have excellent education systems. Brazil needs to learn from these countries.\n#Person1#: So you are hopeful for the future.\n#Person2#: As I said earlier, I'm hopeful. This isn't an easy job. We need to make sure that these important opportunities for Brazil aren't wasted, as they were in the past.
#Person1#: Hey, James, how is the job search going?\n#Person2#: Hi, Sharon, I had no idea. It'll take so much time. It sure makes it difficult to prepare for final exams. How about you?\n#Person1#: I was lucky. There seems to be a shortage of highschool teachers now. I applied to three schools and each one offered me a position.\n#Person2#: That's great. Which one did you like?\n#Person1#: I haven't decided yet. Of course, it will be easiest for me to stay here in New York or go back home to Boston, but I may go to California.\n#Person2#: That will be a big move.\n#Person1#: So tell me about your plans?\n#Person2#: Well, I applied to six newspapers. Last week, I had an interview with New York Times.\n#Person1#: How did it go?\n#Person2#: Not so well. I think they are looking for people with some experience.\n#Person1#: Have you had any other interviews?\n#Person2#: No, not yet. It seems that everyone wants to be a writer these days. There just aren't many jobs out there.\n#Person1#: That's too bad.\n#Person2#: Yes, I had a hope to have a job lined up by graduation. That doesn't seem likely now.\n#Person1#: What will you do if you can't find a job?\n#Person2#: In that case, I'll begin working on the master's degree in the fall.\n#Person1#: Good luck.
#Person1#: I'm free this afternoon. Shall we go to the movies?\n#Person2#: OK. But I hate love stories. Any films about war on today?\n#Person1#: I'm afraid not. How about the theatre?\n#Person2#: Well, most plays are badly written, though they're cheap.\n#Person1#: Let's go to a concert. You like music very much, don't you?\n#Person2#: Yes, light music. But now you can only hear noisy music, American songs or songs where you can't understand a single word.\n#Person1#: What are you going to do then?\n#Person2#: Why not go to the library to borrow some books. You like reading as much as I do, don't you?\n#Person1#: OK, let's.
#Person1#: Excuse me. I'd like to make a complaint.\n#Person2#: Really? What seems to be the problem?\n#Person1#: Well, don't you think you are playing the music too loudly?\n#Person2#: Oh? I'm sorry. I didn't realize it was so loud.\n#Person1#: Yes. I am preparing for my exam next week and your music is bothering me a great deal that I can't hear myself think.\n#Person2#: Sorry. I'll turn it down.
#Person1#: Get up as early as six o'clock only to be jammed at every crossroad and still late for work. What a life! I've had enough of it. \n#Person2#: Cool down, man. Everyone is fed up with the rush-hour traffic. But life isn't really all that. You should take the initiative and make some changes first. \n#Person1#: What should I do then? \n#Person2#: I recommend you ride a bike instead of commuting by bus. It may offer you many beneits. First, it's good for your health. I'm afraid it's not necessary for me to further elaborate. While lots of people spend time like an hour each morning exercising, a bike ride to work not only builds you up, but also makes full use of time. You might as well sleep out for a longer hour. \n#Person1#: I know cycling is always a more favorable choice than a bus. After all, it's a sport. But do you think it a pleasant experience to take in the dirty, pollued air on the road? \n#Person2#: Well, such things are just unavoidable in a great metropolis like Beijing. I think a still more desirable benefit is psychological. Bicycling home after work can help release your stress. Life in the offices is miserable. You just sit there in a daze, gazing at the monitor and dealing with files and documents. Why don't you give a full play to your energy after work? Enjoy the speed on the road. Just think, you are falshing past the poles with your own energy. How great! 
#Person1#: I wouldn't advise you to buy things in bulk from such stores, though. I mean, do your major shopping at the specialized stores. It's much cheaper, and more convenient in the long run. \n#Person2#: Great advice! \n#Person3#: Sort of like Mom's! \n#Person1#: Hey, watch it! \n#Person3#: Just kiddin'! \n#Person2#: Life sounds great in this town! Oh! Before I forget, guys, where can I rent movies? I love watching movies in my spare time. \n#Person1#: Me too! Let's see. There are two video stores close to your apartment. Lucky you! One's Blockbuster, and the other's That's Rentertainment. I believe they both have specials on weekdays, right Will? \n#Person3#: Yup. But not for the new releases. It's usually a buck each for the older movies. \n#Person1#: Are you guys ready to go to the mall? \n#Person2#: Sure. \n#Person1#: Masa, don't forget to take your shopping list with you. \n#Person2#: Thanks for reminding me. \n#Person1#: You're welcome. What are we waiting for? Let's go. 
#Person1#: What are you reading? \n#Person2#: Oh, it's the latest novel by Ray Blune. It's a sic-fi thriller. \n#Person1#: I thought he usually wrote horror books. \n#Person2#: He does. He's good at this genre too. It's a captivating read. \n#Person1#: We're going to the bookshop. Would you like to join us? \n#Person2#: Yes, I would. I need to buy a textbook for my course and, as you know, I love browsing through the latest paperbacks. \n#Person1#: Me too. I need something to read on the flight to New York. I can never sleep on planes. Sarah wants to pick up some children's books for her daughter. \n#Person2#: I want to look at nelson mandela's autobiography. \n#Person1#: This is sure to be a worthwhile read. 
#Person1#: Oh! You're engaged! What a beautiful engagement ring! Who to? \n#Person2#: Of course Mike. Who else? We fell in love at first sight. \n#Person1#: When's the wedding going to be? \n#Person2#: We haven't decided yet. There are a lot of things to sort out, you know. \n#Person1#: Are you having a big wedding? \n#Person2#: Yes, I've always dream of having a big wedding. \n#Person1#: But what do you say about that? \n#Person2#: I don't really enjoy big occasions, but I think I'll come round to the idea in the end, It only happens once in a lifetime. \n#Person1#: Perhaps I'll agree with Mike. I couldn't stand a big wedding with many relatives and friends of my parents or my wife whom I'd never met before. 
#Person1#: I wanna register for this mathematics course. \n#Person2#: I'm sorry registration has closed. \n#Person1#: Closed? The clerk told me I could come back and register any time during the first week of classes. \n#Person2#: Well, that's not possible. The computer's official student account has already been sent to the state. And that's what our budget is based on. Who told you that anyway? \n#Person1#: Some woman in here when I tried to register three weeks ago. She said I just had to pay a late fee. \n#Person2#: She must have been a part-time worker. They didn't have much training. Why didn't you register then? \n#Person1#: She said I couldn't until I had my birth certificate. Here it is. \n#Person2#: Huh, that is no reason to demand a birth certificate. We only need to establish residency, you know, a phone bill with your name and address on it would have been fine. \n#Person1#: Serious? Only the proof of my address. \n#Person2#: Yes, I am afraid she gave you the wrong information. \n#Person1#: But it's unfair. \n#Person2#: Well, I sympathize with your problem, but, to be honest, I don't think there is any thing anyone can do for you. You were trapped in the system. If you want, you can talk to the director. She will help you if she can. \n#Person1#: Great. \n#Person2#: Don't get your hopes up. 
#Person1#: what are you looking for? \n#Person2#: I want to buy a new camcorder for my trip this summer. \n#Person1#: do you know what camcorder options are available? \n#Person2#: not really. I thought I'd just have a look today. \n#Person1#: whould you like to look at the new digital camcorders that have just come in? \n#Person2#: sure. I'd like to see the smallest camcorder that you have first. \n#Person1#: ok. This Sony model is their newest and our most popular camcorder. Why don't you see if you like the way it feel? \n#Person2#: it's very light. That would be good. How is the battery life? \n#Person1#: it's got an above-average battery life. It lasts up tp 12 hours and can be charged in 30 minutes. \n#Person2#: can you also take still photos with this? \n#Person1#: yes, that is an option. \n#Person2#: how about night vision? Can you use it in the dark? \n#Person1#: yes. I can show you examples of some footages that was taken with this camera in the dark. \n#Person2#: that's not bad at all. How's the microphone? Does it pick up much sound? \n#Person1#: It can record any sound that's within about 8 feet of the camera. \n#Person2#: how does that compare with other models? \n#Person1#: there are models that can pick up more sound than this one, but they're much bigger and heavier than this one. \n#Person2#: I guess you can't have everything, can you? 
#Person1#: Dalian is a beautiful city. Do you agree? \n#Person2#: I suppose I do. \n#Person1#: The climate here is pleasant. \n#Person2#: They usually said it\n#Person1#: This city is really comfortable to living. \n#Person2#: It sure is \n#Person1#: No other city can match it. It's heaven. \n#Person2#: Well, if you live in other as long enough you love them just as much. \n#Person1#: Maybe. \n#Person2#: That's for sure. 
#Person1#: What time is it, Steven?\n#Person2#: Uh, it's 7:30. Aren't you going to finish your breakfast?\n#Person1#: I don't have much time. I've got a lot to do downtown today.\n#Person2#: If you're coming into the city, we may have lunch together.\n#Person1#: OK. Let's say 1 o'clock. I'll go to the gym. I have an aerobics class until 11:45. Oh, and it would have to be some place quick.\n#Person2#: How come?\n#Person1#: I have a hair appointment at 2:30.\n#Person2#: Oh, OK. What else are you doing today?\n#Person1#: I'm meeting Rebecca to do some shopping at 5:30 PM.\n#Person2#: Tough day.\n#Person1#: Well, it is my day off, you know.\n#Person2#: OK, OK. Enjoy your morning. I'll see you later.\n#Person1#: You better get going to. You're not even dressed yet.\n#Person2#: Don't worry about me. I'll get to work on time.
#Person1#: Well, good morning, Tom. I haven't seen you for a long time. What seems to be the trouble now?\n#Person2#: I feel very tired. I've got a bad headache, and I can't sleep well almost every night.\n#Person1#: Have you been eating properly? Eating the right kind of food is very important for your health, you know?\n#Person2#: Well, I haven't been eating too well, I guess. I have a lot of work to do, and I usually only have enough time to have a sandwich, and a cup of coffee for lunch.\n#Person1#: And what about dinner?\n#Person2#: Sometimes I'm too tired to eat anything at all.\n#Person1#: It's too bad, you must have a well balanced diet. But I think the most important thing for you to do right now, is to have a good rest.\n#Person2#: Yes, I agree.
#Person1#: I've been having trouble breathing lately, so I made a doctors appointment for Monday morning.\n#Person2#: I thought you just went to the doctor for that same problem.\n#Person1#: No, I went last Tuesday because I had a cough. The time before that, I couldn't feel my legs, but it turned out that I just stood for too long.\n#Person2#: That happened to my uncle once. While I hope it turns out OK for you. Let me know if you need me to bring anything over for you tomorrow after the appointment.\n#Person1#: Thanks. You're a good friend.
#Person1#: I read a report on the people who can use a foreign language, mainly English.\n#Person2#: Really? What's it about?\n#Person1#: It's mainly about the different attitudes people have. Towards the foreign language learning, about 27% of the people think of foreign language is a must in their daily life.\n#Person2#: I can't agree more. There are more and more People learning foreign languages.\n#Person1#: That's true. About 35% of the people are learning or willing to learn a foreign language.\n#Person2#: As far as I'm concerned, many People, especially students are forced to do so because of exams.\n#Person1#: Yes, that accounts for twenty one percent. There are also about 15% of the people who take foreign languages to be useless and they take no interest in them at all.
#Person1#: More and more people are using reusable grocery bags now.\n#Person2#: They're much stronger than plastic bags. And I can fit more in them, too.\n#Person1#: Grocery stores like them, too. Because they can make money by selling them.\n#Person2#: What's more, you can use them for more than one purpose. I heard that only 3% of plastic bags. Imagine all that waste.\n#Person1#: And my local grocery store, regular plastic bags aren't free anymore. In addition, they take $0.10 off your bill for every reusable bag you bring yourself.\n#Person2#: It's great to see we're taking steps to create a healthier environment.
#Person1#: Freeze! Police! Put your hands over your head.\n#Person2#: What crime did I commit?\n#Person1#: You are suspected of hiding illegal drugs, so we are taking you into custody. We ' Ve found some heroin in your house. You have the following rights while you are being interviewed. You have the right to remain silent. You don't have to make any statement against your will. You have the right to defense counsel. You have the right to request an investigation of evidence favorable to your case. Do you understand your rights?\n#Person2#: I am innocent.
#Person1#: I'm going to buy a new living room set.\n#Person2#: Where are you going to buy one?\n#Person1#: I'm really not sure.\n#Person2#: You like my living room set, don't you?\n#Person1#: Where did you buy it?\n#Person2#: I found mine at IKEA.\n#Person1#: Are they expensive?\n#Person2#: Everything I got from IKEA cost me a couple thousand.\n#Person1#: Is the furniture crafted well?\n#Person2#: The furniture isn't built cheap.\n#Person1#: I'll pay the money, as long as I'm getting what I pay for.\n#Person2#: You will feel comfortable paying the money.
#Person1#: I need a snack from the cafeteria.\n#Person2#: What are you thinking of getting?\n#Person1#: I only want some chips.\n#Person2#: I think I may get something too.\n#Person1#: What do you plan on buying?\n#Person2#: I have a sweet tooth. I want candy.\n#Person1#: What kind of candy do you want?\n#Person2#: I really want some chocolate.\n#Person1#: What kind of chocolate do you want?\n#Person2#: I either want a Snickers or a Kit Kat.\n#Person1#: The cafeteria doesn't sell Kit Kats.\n#Person2#: Then I guess I'll just get a Snickers.
#Person1#: How do I make a good impression in the interview?\n#Person2#: You should try to put your best foot forward, and be careful of your personal appearance. At least you should get yourself dressed up. Appearance isnt everything, but it's the first thing an interviewer notices about you.\n#Person1#: Anything else?\n#Person2#: Don't boast and don't be modest.\n#Person1#: What do you mean by this? You can't do the two things at the same time.\n#Person2#: Appear confident and show the interviewers that you're competent. Don't exaggerate things or you'll give the impression that you're talking big.\n#Person1#: I see.\n#Person2#: Try to be natural, alert and interested.\n#Person1#: You'Ve given me very valuable advice and I have more confidence in myself now. Thank you very much.\n#Person2#: My pleasure. Good luck to you.
#Person1#: Hello, Madam. What can I do for you today?\n#Person2#: Hello. Yes, I'm here to redeem a Treasury Note. It's not at the maturity date yet, but it is an emergency.\n#Person1#: OK, can I see the note and some ID, please?\n#Person2#: There you are. As you can see, the maturity isn't up yet.\n#Person1#: You do realise that you must pay a 0. 2 % charge for premature cancellation, right?\n#Person2#: Oh, really? No, I wasn't aware of that.\n#Person1#: Unfortunately, yes. You see, this is a three-year note ; it was issued over a year ago, but not over two years. So, you will have to pay. I'm sorry about that.
#Person1#: Are you going to the cafeteria downstairs?\n#Person2#: Yes.\n#Person1#: Could you please get me a takeaway? I have some urgent work to finish. So I don't have enough time to go out for lunch.\n#Person2#: No problem. What should I bring?\n#Person1#: I am not picky on food. Just bring me the day menu.
#Person1#: Mumm. Those burgers smell great. It's perfect day for a barbecue.\n#Person2#: It sure is. I'm glad it didn't rain. My name's Mike Gates, by the way.\n#Person1#: Oh, hi! I'm Barbara Johnson. Nice to meet you.\n#Person2#: I'm sorry. What's your name again?\n#Person1#: Barbara. But please, just call me Barb.\n#Person2#: So Barb. . . what do you do?\n#Person1#: I'm studying medicine.\n#Person2#: Really? Where?\n#Person1#: At Harvard. What about you?\n#Person2#: I'm an engineer at IBM.\n#Person1#: Oh, are you? That sounds interesting.\n#Person2#: Yeah. I like it. Hey, it looks like the food is ready.\n#Person1#: Good. I'm starving.
#Person1#: Tomorrow will be my first day at work, what do you think I should be wearing?\n#Person2#: Well, if you want to look professional, serious and more conservative, a blue dress, white shirt and not-too-high shoes would be the best choice. But sometimes, very formal clothes will keep you at a distance from your colleagues. It depends on the company's dress code.\n#Person1#: Indeed, I found most of the employees dress casually when I went to the interview. Only the manager was in suit and tie and he just came back from a ceremony. It seems that their dress code is not that formal. Probably, I should put on car key and simple shirt.\n#Person2#: Whatever you choose, make sure they are neat and clean.
#Person1#: Hi, Bill. Are you going to the commencement?\n#Person2#: Yes. Do you want to go with me?\n#Person1#: OK. ( Several minutes later. ) Let's go into the school auditorium.\n#Person2#: Now that take this seat. Do you see those piles of red diplomas on the desks on the stage?\n#Person1#: Yes. I find my heart is now rising and falling like waves, all sorts of feelings welling up in my heart.\n#Person2#: That's true. Four years'trails and hardships, joys and sorrows of life are gushing out to my mind all together. I can hardly tell whether I am joyful or gloomy at the moment when I am about to leave the campus and to start a new stage of my life.\n#Person1#: How time flies. Look, the president of the college has come onto the stage.\n#Person2#: He's going to make the opening speech.
#Person1#: We need to elect club officials before the summer starts.\n#Person2#: I guess we should start with nominees first.\n#Person1#: Let's make it the first item of business in our next meeting.\n#Person2#: We should probably let everyone know ahead of time so they will be prepared.\n#Person1#: Can you take care of sending out a bulletin by e-mail to all the club members?\n#Person2#: Yes, I can do that this afternoon.\n#Person1#: Let's schedule the actual election times the week after the nominations. Doesn't that seem logical?\n#Person2#: Yes, let me put it on the calendar.
#Person1#: Would it be all right if I went home next weekend?\n#Person2#: For What?\n#Person1#: Well, I want to surprise my brother showing up for his birthday.\n#Person2#: Well, that sounds like it would be OK. Just be careful.
#Person1#: As you know I'Ve been thinking about moving my career in a new direction. I am hoping that you will be able to provide me with a reference to help me jump-start my future.\n#Person2#: I realize that I'm not in a position to offer you the kind of promotion you deserve I'll gladly do what I can to help.\n#Person1#: Thank you. I'Ve really enjoyed my time here. I've grown both personally and professionally with this company.\n#Person2#: And, as well as being a pleasure to work with, you'Ve been instrumental in helping us complete many key projects.\n#Person1#: It will be hard to say good-bye. This office has become like a second home to me.\n#Person2#: My feelings are mixed on the issue too. By helping you I'm losing a valuable and trusted employee. However I think you are taking a step in the right direction.
#Person1#: Have you obtained any certificate of technical qualifications or license?\n#Person2#: Yes, I have received an Engineers Qualification Certificate and a drivers license.\n#Person1#: How many years have you had the drivers license?\n#Person2#: I have two years driving experience.\n#Person1#: That's good. What special skills do you have, can you tell me?\n#Person2#: I have experience in computer operation, proficiency in Microsoft Windows, Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel.\n#Person1#: What computer languages have you learned?\n#Person2#: Visual C + +, C and Delphi.\n#Person1#: Have you gotten any special training in programming?\n#Person2#: No, but I have database programming experience and network knowledge.
#Person1#: It's very nice of you to invite me.\n#Person2#: I'm very glad you could come, Mr. Liu. Will you take a seat at the head of the table? It's an informal dinner, please don't stand on ceremony. . . Mr. Liu, would you like to have some chicken?\n#Person1#: Thank you. This is my first time to come to a Chinese restaurant. Could you tell me the different features of Chinese food?\n#Person2#: Generally speaking, Cantonese food is a bit light ; Shanghai food is rather oily ; and Hunan dishes are very spicy, having a strong and hot taste.\n#Person1#: Chinese dishes are exquisitely prepared, delicious, and very palatable. They are very good in colour, flavour, and taste.\n#Person2#: Mr. Liu, would you care for another helping?\n#Person1#: No more, thank you. I'm quite full.\n#Person2#: Did you enjoy the meal?\n#Person1#: It's the most delicious dinner I've had for a long time. It's such a rich dinner.\n#Person2#: I'm so glad you like it.\n#Person1#: Thank you very much for your hospitality.
#Person1#: I'm so hungry! Can you buy me a burrito?\n#Person2#: I don't have any money to buy you a burrito.\n#Person1#: Please? I haven't eaten anything all day.\n#Person2#: Look, I only have money to buy myself a burrito.\n#Person1#: I'm so hungry, I could eat a whole cow!\n#Person2#: If you're so hungry, why don't you ask someone else for money?\n#Person1#: I get paid on Friday, I'll pay you back then.\n#Person2#: Well, I guess on Friday, then you can eat.\n#Person1#: That's pretty messed up.\n#Person2#: Why don't you just go home and eat?\n#Person1#: I don't want to go all the way home just to eat.\n#Person2#: Well, I guess you're out of luck.
#Person1#: I want to check in now. Here is my ticket.\n#Person2#: Don't you have any luggage to check in?\n#Person1#: No, sir.\n#Person2#: Do you have a seat preference?\n#Person1#: I'd like an aisle seat. I feel terrible near the window.\n#Person2#: Here is your boarding pass. Have a nice day.
#Person1#: Good morning, and welcome to our bank. What can I do for you today?\n#Person2#: I need some advice about my fixed deposits.\n#Person1#: What seems to be the problem?\n#Person2#: No, no problem. It's just that one of them is due and I'm not sure how to deal with it.\n#Person1#: I see. Well, you have two choices ; you can renew it or redeem it. Which would you prefer?\n#Person2#: Mmmm. . . well, I am happy with your service so far, so I'd like to renew it, please.\n#Person1#: Not a problem. But may I just inform you that we have introduced a new service called Account Renewing upon Maturity?\n#Person2#: Yes. . .\n#Person1#: You see, that means when anything is up for renewal, we do it automatically and you don't have to physically come here to sort it out. All you need to do is sign here and we'll set it all up for you.\n#Person2#: That's just perfect for me. I live pretty far from the centre and it can be a chore getting in.
#Person1#: Do you like the apartment so far?\n#Person2#: I see a problem.\n#Person1#: What's the problem?\n#Person2#: I noticed that the faucet in the kitchen is leaking.\n#Person1#: That's no big deal.\n#Person2#: It's going to be a problem when my water bill comes.\n#Person1#: What do you want me to do about it?\n#Person2#: I would like you to fix the problem.\n#Person1#: I won't be able to do that right now.\n#Person2#: Well, I won't be able to rent the apartment until the problem is fixed.\n#Person1#: Fine, I'll have it fixed for you.\n#Person2#: I'm happy that we'Ve come to an agreement.
#Person1#: What was the biggest turing point in your life?\n#Person2#: I use I would say that would be moving out of my parents' house for the first time.\n#Person1#: Really? Why is that?\n#Person2#: Till I moved out of my parents' home, I became a lot more independent.\n#Person1#: What would you say was the lowest point in your life?\n#Person2#: That would definitely be getting a divorce.\n#Person1#: What went wrong?\n#Person2#: We just weren't right for each other.\n#Person1#: How long were you married?\n#Person2#: The marriage only lasted about a year.\n#Person1#: Have you remarried since then?\n#Person2#: Yes, I got married to a man that I met shortly after I divorced my first husband.\n#Person1#: Do you think you'll ever get a divorce again?\n#Person2#: Oh I hope not, my first marriage was a mistake, but this one isn't.\n#Person1#: How long have you been married?\n#Person2#: About 15 years now.\n#Person1#: Do you think you'll still love him when he is old and gray?\n#Person2#: I think so, hopefully we'll have a long and a happy life together.\n#Person1#: I'm sure you will.
#Person1#: Hi, did you call for an exterminator?\n#Person2#: Yes! Thank goodness you're here. These bugs are driving us crazy!\n#Person1#: What sort of pest are we dealing with?\n#Person2#: We just bought this house and it is infected with just about everything. We have termites in the wood, cockroaches all over the place, and last night I saw a huge rat out in the backyard!\n#Person1#: Well, there's nothing we can't handle. I'll spray the floorboards and walls to get rid of the cockroaches, but the termites will be harder to get rid of. We will have to cover the entire house and fumigate it. Unfortunately that means you will have to find a place to stay for the next three days.\n#Person2#: No problem, just get rid of the bugs!
#Person1#: Hello, Elizabeth. How are you?\n#Person2#: Fine, thanks.\n#Person1#: Are you sure you're all right? You look a bit worried today. Is anything wrong?\n#Person2#: Well, yes, there is something wrong actually. Perhaps you can give me some advice.\n#Person1#: Of course, if I can.\n#Person2#: Well, last night when I returned from the theatre, I found that I'd lost my wallet.\n#Person1#: Oh dear! That's terrible! What was in your wallet?\n#Person2#: Well, some money. of course, my visa, all my identity cards and some photos.\n#Person1#: Well, if were you, I'd go to the police station straight away and report it.\n#Person2#: Yes, I've already done that, and they said they'd look for it. But we're leaving soon and I need my visa and identity cards badly.\n#Person1#: Oh dear! What a pity! Are you sure you lost the wallet in the theatre?\n#Person2#: Yes, quite sure.\n#Person1#: I think you should put an advertisement in the China Daily, saying when and where you lost it.\n#Person2#: But that takes too long.\n#Person1#: Wait a minute! My uncle lives in Beijing and he lives very close to the theatre. I'll telephone him and ask him to go there to inquire about it. You'd better have breakfast now and I'll meet you later.
#Person1#: I am a reporter from Channel 5 News.\n#Person2#: What's up?\n#Person1#: Could I ask you some questions?\n#Person2#: Sure, you can.\n#Person1#: Did you vote today?\n#Person2#: I sure did!\n#Person1#: What candidate did you vote for?\n#Person2#: I can't disclose that information.\n#Person1#: Why is that?\n#Person2#: My vote is my own private business.\n#Person1#: I understand.\n#Person2#: I voted for our next President.
#Person1#: Hi, Nicole. Did you have a good weekend?\n#Person2#: Yes, I did. But I feel tired today.\n#Person1#: Really? Why?\n#Person2#: Well, on Saturday I cleaned the house and played tennis. Then on Sunday I hiked in the country.\n#Person1#: And I bet you studied, too.\n#Person2#: Yeah. I studied on Sunday evening. What about you?\n#Person1#: Well, I didn't clean the house and I didn't study. I stayed in bed and watched TV.\n#Person2#: That sounds like fun, but did you exercise?\n#Person1#: Sort of. I played golf on my computer!
#Person1#: Good afternoon, Ma'am, My name is Mike and I am selling subscriptions to all sorts of periodicals.\n#Person2#: No, thank you, I am not interested.\n#Person1#: Please ma'am, if you could spare five minutes of your time, I am sure we could find something that interests you!\n#Person2#: I wish I could, but I have to walk the dog and finish cooking so if you would excuse me.\n#Person1#: We have a great variety of magazines all about cooking! This one for example, is a bi-monthly publication with recipes from all over the world!\n#Person2#: Wow, that would be kind of useful, do you have any other cooking magazines?\n#Person1#: Sure do! This one is a quarterly publication, but each issue has over 200 color pages of recipes and also many home decorating ideas!\n#Person2#: Wow, this is nice! Ok, sign me up for both publications.\n#Person1#: You mentioned you have a dog, most pet owners sign up for this weekly newsletter that has information on dog care, pet shops and even pet sitters!\n#Person2#: That is exactly what I needed! What else do you have?\n#Person1#: Well, I also have. . .
#Person1#: Hey! Taxi.\n#Person2#: Where are you heading, sir?\n#Person1#: Capital Airport.\n#Person2#: What's your flight time?\n#Person1#: At 7:50.\n#Person2#: I guess we should get there no later than 7:00.\n#Person1#: How long is the ride from here then?\n#Person2#: Well, since it's rush hour, I'd say the ride would take about thirty minutes, more or less. Is that okay?\n#Person1#: Yes, that'll be fine. How much is this going to cost?
#Person1#: Would you like to copy the EX files and pass me the copy? There are some figures I want to check.\n#Person2#: Here is the copy. Do you need anything else?\n#Person1#: Yes, I also need all the letters we received from them.\n#Person2#: Do you mean all the sales letters from them?\n#Person1#: Yes, that's right.\n#Person2#: I'll get them for you at once. And could I file the report for you?\n#Person1#: Yes, but I need the report copied on transparency paper.\n#Person2#: No problem.
#Person1#: Jenny, you look so strong, quite different from what you used to be. How I envy you!\n#Person2#: I think you've heard the saying: 'A sound mind dwells in a sound body.' I have always tried my best to keep fit for both my study and work.\n#Person1#: Right you are! Can you give me some tips as to how to keep fit?\n#Person2#: To my mind, the best way to keep fit is to go in for sports.\n#Person1#: What kind of sports do you participate in?\n#Person2#: I go swimming once a week. I do this even in cold winter.\n#Person1#: I used to swim in high school, but I don't have time anymore.\n#Person2#: That's too bad. Exercise is really important for your health.\n#Person1#: I know. I'm getting a little fat. I am short of breath when going upstairs.\n#Person2#: That's a bad sign. I think you need more exercise. Well, I'm going swimming tonight. Do you want to go with me?\n#Person1#: OK. I really need to get in shape again.
#Person1#: Good evening. Can I help you?\n#Person2#: Yes, please. I'd like some eggs.\n#Person1#: Eggs? OK. How many?\n#Person2#: A dozen, please.\n#Person1#: Here you are. Anything else?\n#Person2#: Yes. Do you have any green tea here?\n#Person1#: Yes. How much do you want?\n#Person2#: Could I have half a pound?\n#Person1#: Certainly. Here you are.\n#Person2#: How much altogether?\n#Person1#: Let me see. One pound fifty, please.\n#Person2#: Thank you.
#Person1#: Good morning, Mr. Carson, please?\n#Person2#: I'm afraid Mr. Carson is at a very important meeting at the moment and cannot be disturbed. May I know who's calling?\n#Person1#: Yes, this is Mr. Prince. I would like to talk to Mr. Carson today, if possible.\n#Person2#: Well, I'm afraid the meeting won't finish until one o'clock and then he has a lunch appointment. If he has time, I can ask him to ring you before he leaves.\n#Person1#: OK. I'd be grateful if you would.\n#Person2#: Not at all. Mr. Prince. Could I take your telephone number and then I'll ask Mr. Carson to ring you as soon as he's free?\n#Person1#: Yes, it's Hong Kong--68261427 extension 4036.\n#Person2#: Hong Kong--68261427 extension 4036. Right. Perhaps he has no time to ring you this morning, but I will ask him to ring you as soon as he returns from lunch.\n#Person1#: Thank you.
#Person1#: Good morning! May I speak to Mr. Wang?\n#Person2#: Yes, speaking.\n#Person1#: Mr. Wang, this is Liu Li of the Hua Mei Company. There will be a fashion show on the 1st of May. I'd like to invite you and your photographic team to come here.\n#Person2#: Marvelous! I'd love to. When will we arrive?\n#Person1#: We will send you invitation cards and I will need to know the size of your team.\n#Person2#: We have a total of 10.\n#Person1#: Ok. Then I'll send you the cards. See you.\n#Person2#: Thank you. Bye.
#Person1#: Hello?\n#Person2#: Hello, Bob? This is Nancy. I got the invitation yesterday.\n#Person1#: Oh, can you come?\n#Person2#: Yes, I think so, but Tony can't. He's got to go to his parents' and help them work on their house this weekend.\n#Person1#: Oh, that's too bad.\n#Person2#: Uh, Bob. I won't have any transportation that night. Think somebody could give me a ride?\n#Person1#: Oh, sure! There's a group of people coming who live near you. I'm sure one of them would be glad to. If that doesn't work out, I'll drive you.\n#Person2#: Great! Thanks, Bob. Uh, what will people be wearing?\n#Person1#: Oh, you needn't dress up. It's a fairly casual party. We'll be in the yard, you know.\n#Person2#: Good. I can wear my new pants and sweater. Uh, what can I bring?\n#Person1#: Well, a side dish would be good. There'll be plenty to drink.\n#Person2#: OK, see you then.\n#Person1#: Bye!
#Person1#: I thought it was a great movie, so visually exciting.\n#Person2#: I hate to admit it, but I jumped in my seat a few times, too.\n#Person1#: The shark looked so real at times!\n#Person2#: I guess recent advances in camera technology helped a lot.
#Person1#: Hey, Lucy. Do you have some time to talk about next week's trip with me?\n#Person2#: Sure, Dave.\n#Person1#: OK. So, we're leaving on Monday from Hartsfield International Airport, and returning on Friday. Do we take ourselves to the airport? Maybe we need to book a taxi, or just go by bus.\n#Person2#: No, we don't have to. The company car will pick us up and take us there.\n#Person1#: Oh, that's good. When?\n#Person2#: Our flight leaves at 11:00 a.m., so they should pick us up between 8:00 and 9:00 a.m. Besides, the company pays for our trip, including hotel and food.\n#Person1#: How much will that be?\n#Person2#: Well, New York is a pretty expensive city. So, each of us will get $200 a day.\n#Person1#: Oh, OK. Thanks for telling me that.\n#Person2#: You're welcome.
#Person1#: Hello, Jane. This is Peter speaking.\n#Person2#: Hi, how are you?\n#Person1#: Fine. And I've got some great news for you.\n#Person2#: Really? What's it about?\n#Person1#: I remember you are interested in watching golf games. The Houston Open will be running from May 26 to May 30. I'm sure you will be glad to watch the game.\n#Person2#: Oh, that's great. But just a moment, let me check. Ah... It is a pity that I can't make it. I will be on business in China from May 25 to June 2.\n#Person1#: Well, I'm sorry you have to be away on business then. Let me see. Another game, the US Open will be running from July 15 to July 18. How about that?\n#Person2#: That's great. I will be on my holiday then. It would be wonderful if we could watch the game together.
#Person1#: Customer Service. Anthony Grant speaking. How may I help you?\n#Person2#: I can't believe this is happening. I called and ordered a 32-inch bag last Friday. But today I found that you sent a 24-inch one. I'm planning to use that bag during our vacation in Mexico. But it doesn't seem possible any more, because we'll take off on Saturday. It's only 2 days away. What am I supposed to do?\n#Person1#: I'm really sorry, madam. I'll check right away. Would you please tell me your order number?\n#Person2#: It's CE2938.\n#Person1#: Just a minute. I do apologize, madam. There did seem to be a mistake. I'll have the correct size bag sent to you by overnight mail right away. It will arrive in time for your Saturday trip. Again I apologize for any inconvenience caused by our mistake. I promise it won't happen again.\n#Person2#: OK, well. Thank you.\n#Person1#: Thank you, madam, for choosing Lynch Mail. I hope you have a wonderful vacation.
#Person1#: I think I'll get one of those new T-shirts, you know, with the school's logo on both the front and the back.\n#Person2#: You'll regret it. They are expensive, and I've heard the printing fades easily when you wash them.
#Person1#: Hi, Lily, how's your new flat?\n#Person2#: It's great. I really like it.\n#Person1#: How big is it?\n#Person2#: It's one big room, but it has a bathroom and a small kitchen, too.\n#Person1#: How far is it from the office.\n#Person2#: It's only about 10 minutes.\n#Person1#: 10 minutes by bus or by car?\n#Person2#: On foot. I walked to work this morning. I was 10 minutes early.\n#Person1#: You are lucky. I was 10 minutes late.\n#Person2#: What happened\n#Person1#: All the buses came late.\n#Person2#: What did Susan say?\n#Person1#: She was late too.\n#Person2#: What happened to her?\n#Person1#: She took the train, and it was late too.\n#Person2#: Well then you're really lucky after all. But what are you going to do tomorrow.\n#Person1#: I'll start 15 minutes earlier.
#Person1#: Who put this pile of magazines in my office?\n#Person2#: Alice. She said you were going to take them back to the library.\n#Person1#: Oh, that's right. She did ask me to take some magazines back for her. I completely forgot.
#Person1#: Movie box offices sales have been down almost 10 percent this summer. What happened?\n#Person2#: Many things. Now they have more choices about how to spend their leisure time. DVD business certainly has effect on movie-going and obviously we need better quality of films and more entertaining ones.\n#Person1#: How about movie theaters?\n#Person2#: Most theaters today should be made more comfortable and cleaner. I hate to see the theater with stuff of garbage. I also think they should be better food available so that people feel good and enjoy there.\n#Person1#: I've heard some people complain that Hollywood releases too late films a year. What's your opinion?\n#Person2#: There are probably coining out on crowded days, in the summer and at Christmas time. But generally,there are films as we know. Well, personally, I think movies business today is still healthy and it's a great business too. Ever since everybody feels pretty good.\n#Person1#: If you want to relax yourself to watch a movie at home, what would be your choice?\n#Person2#: If I have to pick one, I choose to see the god father and the god father part n. I think these two are great films of all time.
#Person1#: Hello, sir. How many in your party? \n#Person2#: Just myself. What is the rate? \n#Person1#: OK, a single fare is $50 per right. \n#Person2#: Fine. Do I have to show my passport? \n#Person1#: No, it's not necessary. But you have to fill out this form. \n#Person2#: Sure. 
#Person1#: Look at you, you are so cute. Hey, does this guy have a name?\n#Person2#: Yes, that's Hopper. We call him that because of how he likes to jump around and eat a lot of carrots.\n#Person1#: He seems to be getting along with the other animals too.\n#Person2#: All of the animals you see here have been rescued, and in most cases, they are separated from their mothers.They're all like brothers and sisters.\n#Person1#: I have a dog and a cat at home. Do you think it would be too stressful for him?\n#Person2#: Not at all. As long as your animals are well trained it shouldn't be a problem. You should get a cage for him, though.\n#Person1#: Is he healthy? Or does he need to be taken to an animal doctor first?\n#Person2#: He's 100% healthy.\n#Person1#: I'll take him. Come here, hopper.
#Person1#: Hi Lucy, is there anything special today at school?\n#Person2#: Hi dad, today, Maria asked if she could copy my math homework.\n#Person1#: What did you tell her?\n#Person2#: I said no, because that was cheating.\n#Person1#: Good. I'm glad that you said no. She needs to do her own work.\n#Person2#: She is smart, but I think she is just lazy.
#Person1#: Thank you for calling the Hillside Gallery. How can I help you?\n#Person2#: Hello. Is there a photography exhibition this weekend?\n#Person1#: Yes, there is.\n#Person2#: How much is the ticket?\n#Person1#: Tickets for the gallery are 10 pounds and half price for children, but this includes the painting exhibitions, too. If you only want to see the photography exhibition, it's 7 pounds per person, with half price for children, too.\n#Person2#: The gallery's on Flower Street, isn't it?\n#Person1#: No, we moved to a different building last year. Our present address is 25 Gardenia Road. It's opposite to the Town Square.\n#Person2#: Oh, I see. Does the number 25 bus go by it?\n#Person1#: Yes, but I suggest you not take a bus or drive here. You will be stuck in a traffic jam at weekends on this street. The underground is easy and fast.\n#Person2#: OK. Thank you for your help.
#Person1#: Oh, I wish that bus would come! My feet are freezing. I suppose I've been here for 10 minutes or so.\n#Person2#: That's long enough in the winter.\n#Person1#: This morning the sun was shining!\n#Person2#: But it started to snow one hour ago. They're still predicting 2 or 3 inches.\n#Person1#: Well, I won't go into the office tomorrow. I'll just work from home.\n#Person2#: What do you do?\n#Person1#: I'm a lawyer. My office is around the corner.\n#Person2#: Oh, I work in the same building, in that travel agency next to the lobby. I've seen you walk by several times. Stop in and have a cup of coffee sometime!\n#Person1#: OK, thanks.
#Person1#: What kind of wine did you have sir?\n#Person2#: We had red wine one bottle of the house wine.\n#Person1#: Just a moment, I'll check with the waitress. All right, sir. I corrected the mistake.\n#Person2#: I like to pay by check, do accept out of town checks?\n#Person1#: Yes, do you have some identification?\n#Person2#: I have my drivers license and two credit cards, is that alright?\n#Person1#: Yes, that's fine. Ah, I see you're from Halifax. How do you like Montreal?\n#Person2#: I think it's a marvelous city.\n#Person1#: How long are you going to be here?\n#Person2#: For 3 more days until Tuesday. We arrived 2 days ago.\n#Person1#: I hope you enjoy your visit here.\n#Person2#: Thank you.

He has also become an independent producer and director.\n#Person1#: You know only what aspect of him.

He still puts on quite a dinner time show.\n#Person2#: What does he do there?\n#Person1#: Imagine a big cook cutting vegetables on fast forward, picture a man making the fry, throwing the mixture up in the air and then catching it every last bit in his frying pan, and his cooking motto is 'enjoy the moment'.

#Person1#: Excuse me, is this seat taken?\n#Person2#: No, I don't think so.\n#Person1#: Thanks. I am waiting for the train at 9:00 o'clock to Shanghai. Where will you go?\n#Person2#: What a coincidence! We are on the same train.\n#Person1#: Really? What is your seat number?\n#Person2#: No.5 on the second row, and you?\n#Person1#: I am on the third row No.10.\n#Person2#: Could you please keep an eye on my luggage? I want to go to the washroom.\n#Person1#: No problem.\n#Person2#: Thank you so much.
#Person1#: Come on, Dad. The shops will be closed if we don't hurry.\n#Person2#: Don't worry and the shops are open until midnight on Christmas Eve.\n#Person1#: Yes, but it will take us a long time to find a car park and it will be midnight before we choose a present for mother. Plus, we don't know what to buy for her. Maybe a hat.\n#Person2#: No, she is already had so many hats.\n#Person1#: Well, maybe a box of chocolates.\n#Person2#: But she never eats them. Anything else is OK. You know, she will be satisfied with what you buy for her.
#Person1#: Do you eat a lot of healthy food?\n#Person2#: Compared with healthy food, unhealthy food just tastes so much better. And anyway, I believe if you live a low stress Life and are active, you can get away with eating whatever you like. It's all in the mind.\n#Person1#: You have the point. I think cancer is caused by more worry than by the things we consume. Some good things you should try are cranberry juice, wild rice and yoghurt.\n#Person2#: What's special about these things?\n#Person1#: Cranberry juice is very good for destroying harmful bacteria in your guts because it's very acidic. Wild rice is high in fibre so it's good for your guts and it's high in protein and minerals-I think it's also tastier than normal rice. Yoghurt's good because it's also rich in protein, vitamins and is also acidic. People have been making yoghurt for thousands of years and if you have it every day, your guts will be much more settled.\n#Person2#: Thanks. I'm going to follow your advice and pop down to the supermarket right now.
#Person1#: This is our Submission of Tender which includes the information about volume of the project, the cost and so on.\n#Person2#: OK! We'll see it.\n#Person1#: What kind of guarantee are you going to provide for us?\n#Person2#: We can provide you with standby letter of credit established by Bank of China.\n#Person1#: Should we pay earnest money?\n#Person2#: Yes, you are supposed to pay it on time. If you don't furnish a tender bond on time, your tender will not be considered. Besides, you also should provide derailed engineering of the good.\n#Person1#: Where do we submit the tender?\n#Person2#: To our office which is on the third floor.\n#Person1#: Oh, I see. By the way, is tender-opening done publicly?\n#Person2#: Yes. All the bidders will be invited to join us to supervise the tender-opening.\n#Person1#: And are the prices stated in the US dollar?\n#Person2#: Yes, so far as we know, in the field, your company has lots of experience and we hope you will consider the tender seriously.\n#Person1#: OK! We will. Bye!\n#Person2#: Bye!
#Person1#: So what do you think of my new dress?\n#Person2#: I think it ' s great! I really like the color, and it goes really well with your eyes. I ' Ve actually been eyeing that dress at Maxine ' s for a while now, but I wasn ' t sure I could afford ninety-five dollars for a dress at the moment.\n#Person1#: Um, ninety-five dollars?\n#Person2#: Yes, that ' s the price they were advertising it at. I was hoping it might go on sale soon. Why, how much did you pay for it?\n#Person1#: I bought it for one hundred and forty-five dollars at Helen ' s Boutique. I didn ' t know I could get it cheaper somewhere else.\n#Person2#: Of course! Everything at Helen ' s is overpriced, and they sell things that you can find at almost every other clothing store! Why didn ' t you shop around?\n#Person1#: I don ' t know, I just saw the dress and thought about how pretty it looks and how much I wanted it. I guess I was too impulsive.
#Person1#: Good afternoon, Peace restaurant, may I help you?\n#Person2#: I'd like to reserve a table for two, my wife and I.\n#Person1#: Yes, sir. What time would you like, sir?\n#Person2#: I'm not sure. Perhaps around 8 PM.\n#Person1#: Fine, a reserve a table for two at 8 PM, sir, may I have your name, please?\n#Person2#: Juliet, Juliet Berman.\n#Person1#: Thank you, Mr.Berman. and you prefer smoking or non-smoking?\n#Person2#: Non-smoking will be fine, please. But it is more important that you get a table by the window. It's our anniversary, and I'd like to be very special.\n#Person1#: I'll try my best. With a toward to having with this tonight, Mr.Berman.\n#Person2#: Thank you, goodbye.\n#Person1#: Goodbye, and have a nice day.
#Person1#: Hello, Parker. How ' s everything?\n#Person2#: Can ' t complain. And you?\n#Person1#: Business is booming. I understand you want to meet up with me next week. How ' s your schedule looking?\n#Person2#: Let me see. I can come out and see you first thing Wednesday.\n#Person1#: Great.
#Person1#: You are looking really healthy lately. What are you doing differently?\n#Person2#: Thank you for noticing! I've been making a few lifestyle changes over the past year.\n#Person1#: Tell me about it. I'm interested.\n#Person2#: Well, it all started when my brother challenged me to quit smoking.\n#Person1#: Ha! That's right. You used to smoke. I forgot!\n#Person2#: When I kicked that habit, I found I had so much more energy. I started exercising.\n#Person1#: At the gym?\n#Person2#: No. I like to be outside. I took up hiking and mountain biking.
#Person1#: How did you find your apartment?\n#Person2#: You can check on the bulletin boards at school for local housing.\n#Person1#: What if I need a roommate?\n#Person2#: There are websites that can hook you up with a roommate.\n#Person1#: How much do apartments cost around here?\n#Person2#: It depends on what you want. Do you want a one - or two-bedroom apartment?\n#Person1#: I just need a one-bedroom apartment.\n#Person2#: That will probably cost you around twelve hundred dollars a month.\n#Person1#: Would you come with me to look at apartments?\n#Person2#: I would be happy to look at apartments with you.
#Person1#: Hey, Jeff, where's your stereo?\n#Person2#: I needed some money, so I hocked it last week.\n#Person1#: You must have been really hurting for cash to have done that.\n#Person2#: I had just enough money to make ends meet until payday. Then last Wednesday I received a phone bill to the tune of $ 195. 00. I hit the ceiling when I saw that.\n#Person1#: It sounds like you weren't expecting that.\n#Person2#: I'd forgotten that my brother had used my phone earlier this month to call his girlfriend. He forgot to mention that she happened to be in New York at the time 3000 miles away.\n#Person1#: Well, if you need some money to tide you over until payday, I can loan you some.\n#Person2#: Thanks, but tomorrow's payday I can make until then. Thanks any-way.
#Person1#: How are the children doing at sport?\n#Person2#: I'm very pleased with their performances. Timmy can cover the 100 meters in 12 seconds. That's very fast for a kid his age.\n#Person1#: He's not very good at the long jump though, is he?\n#Person2#: He's not bad. He can jump a distance of over four meters. I think he just prefers running to jumping. Jimmy's very good at the high jump. He can jump over two meters. Again, that's fine for someone hi\n#Person1#: Two meters? That means that the high jump bar is above his head! Are any of them good at long-distance running?\n#Person2#: The longest race we run is the 1500 meters. A few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes.\n#Person1#: How are they at swimming?\n#Person2#: They're ok. I ask them to swim 500 meters each day. That's 20 lengths of the swimming pool. They're not very fast, but that's ok. I just want them to build their strength up and keep in shape.\n#Person1#: Kate is very good at diving from a height of 10 meters.\n#Person2#: I'd be afraid to jump from that height!\n#Person1#: I think that these kinds haven't learnt to be afraid yet. She started diving from a lower height, but she soon wanted to go higher.\n#Person2#: It seems that they really enjoy to go faster, higher and further.
#Person1#: Hello?\n#Person2#: Hi, Randy. What are you going to do this weekend?\n#Person1#: I'Ve no idea. Nothing really.\n#Person2#: How about going hunting with me?\n#Person1#: Wonderful.\n#Person2#: Okay. I'll pick you up around 6\n#Person1#: I'll be ready.
#Person1#: Can you believe the headlines?\n#Person2#: What are you reading?\n#Person1#: I'm reading about Michael Milliken, the Bond King.\n#Person2#: Didn't he sell worthless stocks to people or something? He got arrested for that, didn't he?\n#Person1#: He got arrested all right.\n#Person2#: If I remember, he got off with a light sentence. Something like three years in a minimum-security prison.\n#Person1#: Yup, that's him. He made millions of dollars selling bonds to people and ended up with a pile of cash when they became useless.\n#Person2#: I think the government fined him a small amount, and he kept the rest in his foreign bank accounts. He's still a millionaire.\n#Person1#: That's the kind of thing in America that gets me mad. Some guy pulls off a stock scheme and makes millions while spending the bare minimum sentence in jail.\n#Person2#: I know. And some poor guy that robs a liquor store makes $ 500 at most and ends up in jail for five to ten years.\n#Person1#: Yup, you got it. Criminals in America do a lot better if they're white-collar thieves.\n#Person2#: So what's Michael Milliken up to these days?\n#Person1#: He's giving lectures on business at colleges.
#Person1#: I really want to switch things up.\n#Person2#: What were you thinking?\n#Person1#: I think I want to try a new style.\n#Person2#: What would you like me to do?\n#Person1#: I want you to cut my hair shorter.\n#Person2#: How short?\n#Person1#: I want my hair to be only a few inches long.\n#Person2#: Do you really want it that short?\n#Person1#: Yes, I've been wanting it short for a while now.\n#Person2#: If you really want me to, then I'll do it.\n#Person1#: I'm absolutely sure that this is what I want.\n#Person2#: Let's do it.
#Person1#: May I ask what the name is the girl?\n#Person2#: Which one?\n#Person1#: The tallest one.\n#Person2#: She is Miao Li. She's come here to see her brother.\n#Person1#: Oh, it's so. She looks very lovely. Could you give me some else information on her?\n#Person2#: OK. She's a costume designer and works in a garment mill.\n#Person1#: How do you think about her?\n#Person2#: She looks very beautiful. She is a nice girl.\n#Person1#: I'm wondering if she has boyfriend.\n#Person2#: No, she hasn't.\n#Person1#: Great! Thank you very much.
#Person1#: Mr. Lee, I was wondering if you and your wife had plans for next Friday night?\n#Person2#: Yes, I think we might be free. What did you have in mind?\n#Person1#: I've mailed a formal written invitation to your home inviting you to a dinner party at my home.\n#Person2#: That sounds great. Is it casual?\n#Person1#: Actually, we thought it would be fun to have a formal sit-down dinner for the holidays.\n#Person2#: That sounds good. It will give my wife a chance to dress up.\n#Person1#: Yes, we've invited four other couples, so it should be a good mix of people.\n#Person2#: That sounds wonderful. Will there be anyone there that I know?\n#Person1#: Oh yes, everyone we are inviting is from our company.\n#Person2#: Great! I'll look forward to it. We'll make sure and check the mail for our invitation.
#Person1#: I really like my debate class.\n#Person2#: Do you think you'll be interested in studying law later?\n#Person1#: I've entertained the idea. But I'm I leaning more toward politics.\n#Person2#: You want to be a politician? Yuck.\n#Person1#: That's not like you to generalize.\n#Person2#: Sorry, you're right. I think you'll be a good politician.\n#Person1#: I think I can do a lot of good for our country.\n#Person2#: You're right. We need more people like you in politics.
#Person1#: Hi, do you have any tickets for the show tonight?\n#Person2#: Sorry, it's all sold out.\n#Person1#: Well, do you have any for tomorrow?\n#Person2#: We have tickets for the matinee. It starts at 3p. m.\n#Person1#: Ok. I'll take it.\n#Person2#: Where would you like to sit?\n#Person1#: Do you have anything in the middle section? I want a good view, but sitting too close hurts my eyes.\n#Person2#: Certainly.
#Person1#: I've read your report, and I'm not sure I agree with you. You think you can get attendance improved by requiring salaried employees to take their all of their sick days?\n#Person2#: That's right. I know it must sound crazy to you, but we believe there will be fewer absences this way.\n#Person1#: We give them 10 or 15 sick days per year. Surely requiring people to take them couldn't possibly help. It sounds like a counter - productive policy change to me.\n#Person2#: Right now, we have incentives encouraging employees to come to work as often as possible. But employees with colds and the flu are coming to work and infecting their colleagues.\n#Person1#: I see. So our current policies are encouraging sick people to come to work, resulting in more sick employees.\n#Person2#: That's right. If sick days were mandatory, sick people would stay home. We wouldn't have these company-wide epidemics.\n#Person1#: Let's give it a shot!
#Person1#: Bobby! Come here, look what I got you!\n#Person2#: What is that?\n#Person1#: A chess board! Daddy is going to teach you how to play!\n#Person2#: Cool!\n#Person1#: Ok, each player gets 16 pieces. You can be the white ones and I'll play with the black pieces. Now in the front, you set up the pawns. Those are the least valuable pieces and can only move one space forward. When you are about to capture another piece, it can move one space diagonally.\n#Person2#: What about all these other pieces?\n#Person1#: See this one that looks like a tower? It's called the rook. The one with the tall hat is called the bishop. See this little horsey? This is called the knight, it's a very important piece so it's best to not let your opponent capture it.\n#Person2#: And these two? They are husband and wife?\n#Person1#: That's right! That's the queen and that's the king. If the other player captures your king, he will say ' Check Mate ' and the game is over! Doesn't this sound fun?\n#Person2#: Nah! This is boring! I'm gonna go play Killer Zombies on my PlayStation!
#Person1#: May I help you?\n#Person2#: Yes, I would like to place an order for toner cartridges. We have a standing agreement with you company, so we will need the same amount as last time.\n#Person1#: Let me key in your information into my computer. I will pull up our records for you. Do you have an order number? What name is the order listed under?\n#Person2#: It should be under Leslie Smith. The number is 184796 A.\n#Person1#: Yes, Mr. Smith. I have an order for three cases of cartridges, it that what you would like to refill?\n#Person2#: Yes.\n#Person1#: Is there the correct billing address?\n#Person2#: No, PLS post the bill to 124 Hildrod Lane, Milton County, 98830.\n#Person1#: I will send you an invoice in the next few days. Your order should be delivered before the end of the day on Monday.\n#Person2#: Thank you.
#Person1#: why are there still so many people overweight despite the current fitness craze?\n#Person2#: well, there are certain factors that effect people's size and weight.\n#Person1#: what are they?\n#Person2#: one study said that low-income groups have a higher percentage of over-weight people than higher income families.\n#Person1#: why?\n#Person2#: the survey said that the low, income groups eat more junk food on a daily basis.\n#Person1#: that makes sense. Probably less time to make dinner and the junk food is cheaper.\n#Person2#: and junk food contains lots of fat and oil. There is one final reason why so many people are fat.\n#Person1#: what's that?\n#Person2#: nobody exercises anymore-not even kids! The average american home has the TV on for 6 hours a day!\n#Person1#: wow! No wonder people are so fat. Say, Carl, looks like you could be doing a bit more exercising.\n#Person2#: yeah, I guess so.\n#Person1#: you should consider eating healthier food and getting some more exercise.\n#Person2#: hey, I started a diet and lost 10 pounds.\n#Person1#: so what happened?\n#Person2#: well, I quit and gained it back plus 5 pounds.\n#Person1#: you should have kept trying.
#Person1#: What separates your product from the competition?\n#Person2#: Our product features inventory tracking software, which continuously updates and tracks your inventory on a real-time basis.\n#Person1#: Is the software user-friendly?\n#Person2#: Yes it is very easy to use and each system installation comes with a 3 - day employee training seminar.\n#Person1#: Is this training part of the package or will it cost extra?\n#Person2#: Our quoted price includes the software system, installation, 3 day training seminar and ongoing troubleshooting. There are no hidden costs.
#Person1#: Good evening, ma'am. Table for one?\n#Person2#: Yes, please.\n#Person1#: Will this table be all right?\n#Person2#: Actually, I'd like a booth by the window if that's possible.\n#Person1#: Certainly. How about this one?\n#Person2#: This will be fine, thanks.\n#Person1#: ( Handing her a menu ) Your waiter will be here in a minute to take your order.\n#Person2#: Thank you.
#Person1#: Don't you feel a little strange taking the place of your old boss after he was demoted?\n#Person2#: Yes, at first I felt very awkward. After Bill was demoted and then resigned, it was kind of like somebody died! I mean the atmosphere in the office was like a funeral parlor or something. And then I was afraid people would look at me as a traitor for filling in his spot when the management asked me to. . .\n#Person1#: Did they mutiny?\n#Person2#: Thankful, no. I guess everyone understands the opportunity I had to step into a leadership role is so great for my career. I'm really moving up the ladder now that I'm considered a supervisor. After a couple weeks, it was like nothing happened.\n#Person1#: It is a really good chance for you to get more exposure at work. supervisors get to take the credit for all the hard work of the people under them.\n#Person2#: Yeah, and they also take the blame, that's what happened to my old boss. . .
#Person1#: I'm free on Sunday. I'd like to take a look in Beijing City, could you tell me where to go?\n#Person2#: Sure, no problem. I'll ring to have a city tour. on sunday morning we can go to the Great Wall, then we can go to the summer palace in the afternoon. In the evening we can have typical dinner in restaurant in Beijing. Quanjude, a restaurant serving roast ducks. However if you don't like above trips, we can go some famous places outside of Beijing.\n#Person1#: Any place will be fine. you make the decision.\n#Person2#: What time shall we start?\n#Person1#: I will pick you up at your hotel at eight in the morning.\n#Person2#: Ok, then see you in sunday morning.
#Person1#: May I see your boarding pass?\n#Person2#: Here you go.\n#Person1#: 48C. It's on your left hand side.\n#Person2#: Thank you.\n#Person1#: Please fasten your seat belt, miss.\n#Person2#: Oops! I forgot.\n#Person1#: Also, please place your carry-on luggage either under your seat or in the overhead compartment.\n#Person2#: I think I'll put my bag in the overhead compartment.\n#Person1#: Allow me to give you a hand.
#Person1#: I would love to rent out your apartment.\n#Person2#: That's great.\n#Person1#: How much is the rent?\n#Person2#: The rent each month is $ 1050.\n#Person1#: That's a lot of money.\n#Person2#: Did you have a better price in mind?\n#Person1#: What about $ 800?\n#Person2#: That's way too low.\n#Person1#: I can't pay much more than that.\n#Person2#: How about $ 900 a month?\n#Person1#: That would be fine.\n#Person2#: Great. It was a pleasure doing business with you.
#Person1#: Do you like shopping?\n#Person2#: Yeah. I go shopping once a week\n#Person1#: Why don't you do your shopping at home?\n#Person2#: What do you mean? I can't understand.\n#Person1#: I mean you can buy things through the Internet, that is E-commerce.\n#Person2#: Really? That's unbelievable.
#Person1#: What are you going to do with that vase, Penny?\n#Person2#: I'm going to put it on this table, Sam.\n#Person1#: Don't do that. Give it to me.\n#Person2#: What are you going to do with it?\n#Person1#: I'm going to put it here, in front of the window.\n#Person2#: Be careful. Don't drop it! Don't put it there, Sam. Put it here, on this shelf.\n#Person1#: There we are! It's a lovely vase.\n#Person2#: Those flowers are lovely, too.
#Person1#: Hello. I want to purchase an old music box.\n#Person2#: We have a good variety. What decade would you like?\n#Person1#: I was hoping I could find something made in the'20s.\n#Person2#: There are six on this table.\n#Person1#: I hope at least one of them has dancing figures.\n#Person2#: Many people like the dancing figures. Two of our boxes have the figures.\n#Person1#: So hard to choose. I think I'll take this one.\n#Person2#: That one will bring you many hours of pleasure.\n#Person1#: Does a warranty come with this music box?\n#Person2#: I'm sorry, but if it breaks down, you're on your own.\n#Person1#: I just thought I would ask.\n#Person2#: When you buy a Model T, you can't expect a warranty.
#Person1#: Hi, I heard you're looking for a different apartment.\n#Person2#: Yeah. The place I'm in now is really terrible.\n#Person1#: It was OK when I was there.\n#Person2#: The boiler keeps breaking and when it does, we lose the heat for several days at the time.\n#Person1#: Why doesn't the owner replace it?\n#Person2#: Well, she said it's cheaper to keep fixing it. She is a nice enough person, just sort of stingy in any case. I'm sick of being cold.\n#Person1#: Can you get your deposit back if you move?\n#Person2#: If I give one-month notice, I can get the whole thing back.\n#Person1#: So what kind of place are you looking for?\n#Person2#: I think I'll try to get into one of those highrises near the university. There is nothing really special but at least they are new and functional.\n#Person1#: I heard those buildings are pretty noisy. The walls are thin and you can hear everything going on in the other apartment.\n#Person2#: Oh. That will never do. I need some place quiet to finish my thesis. I guess I'll have to look at some more ads. Maybe new isn't necessarily better.\n#Person1#: Why don't you try some of those apartment at Windsor? They're supposed to be nice.\n#Person2#: Oh, aren't they awfully expensive?\n#Person1#: Not really. You'll he surprised at how reasonable some of them are. The problem with being out there is the bus doesn't run that way.\n#Person2#: That definitely won't be a problem. I can afford a car right now. I guess I'd better check a few places here in the city before I make a decision.
#Person1#: Uh, hi. Do you need some help with those weights? I can move them for you.\n#Person2#: Uh, no. I can do it myself. I just have to put them back over there.\n#Person1#: No, let me help you. Uh, Oh, Hmpf.\n#Person2#: Oh, it's okay.\n#Person1#: Oh, my back!\n#Person2#: It's okay, it's okay. Are you okay?\n#Person1#: I just need to lie down here. Uh. Do you come here often?\n#Person2#: Yeah. I usually come five times a week.\n#Person1#: Oh, oh man. By the way, my name's Justin.\n#Person2#: I'm Rachel.\n#Person1#: Uh, so, where are you from?\n#Person2#: I'm originally from California ... Are you sure you're okay?\n#Person1#: (Said in agony) Yeah, um, I'm okay. Where are you from?\n#Person2#: Um, I spent most of my life in a small town in Utah called Spanish Fork actually.\n#Person1#: Oh, um, I just need to lie here.\n#Person2#: Um, so, where are you from, Justin? I'm going to call the manager.\n#Person1#: No, no, no, no, no! I just need to rest. Oh yeah, I'm from, from, uh, from Spanish Fork.\n#Person2#: Wait. Are you sure? You're just not thinking right.\n#Person1#: No, no, no. Not Spanish .... Ah, No, I'm from Salt Lake City. So, what do you do for a living anyway? Are you a body builder or something?\n#Person2#: No, no. I'm a teacher.\n#Person1#: Oh, so what do you teach?\n#Person2#: I teach math and science, and it doesn't take a science teacher to tell me that you need a doctor.\n#Person1#: No, I'm okay, I'm okay. I'll stand here in a minute. Uh, could I have your phone number? You know, just in case.\n#Person2#: I don't think so. I think 911 is the number you need at this point.\n#Person1#: (Crying in pain) Ohhhh!
#Person1#: Hello, Mike. What are you doing in this part of London?\n#Person2#: Well, in fact, I'm looking for a flat round here.\n#Person1#: A flat? Do you want to move?\n#Person2#: Yes, actually, believe it or not, Mandy and I are getting married.\n#Person1#: It's great! Congratulations. When did you decide?\n#Person2#: Only last week. It was when we were staying with her family in Scotland. Now we're trying to find a suitable flat.\n#Person1#: It will be great to have you as neighbours. I hope you manage to buy one soon.\n#Person2#: Oh, we aren't looking for one to buy. We don't have enough money yet. We want to find somewhere to rent.\n#Person1#: Yes, of course. That's what we did at first. In fact, in the end my brother lent us some money. That's how we managed to buy ours.\n#Person2#: Really? Perhaps I'll talk to my family about it. Now, what about a coffee? There's a good place just round the corner.\n#Person1#: What a good idea!
#Person1#: Honey, how long have we been living here?\n#Person2#: About 10 years. What's wrong?\n#Person1#: I am thinking about redecorating our house.\n#Person2#: That would cost a lot of money. But we do need to do some changes to the house.\n#Person1#: Right. What about repainting the living room in yellow?\n#Person2#: Good idea. I like the countryside style.\n#Person1#: Great minds think the same. And we can also ask someone to draw a picture on the wall.\n#Person2#: It sounds great. And the curtain should be changed too.\n#Person1#: OK. Maybe we should make a blue program first.
#Person1#: What are you doing, Mum?\n#Person2#: I'm planting cabbage.\n#Person1#: What's that in your hand?\n#Person2#: Cabbage seed. You see, I put some soil in the box, sow the seed carefully like this, and then cover it with more soil. I'll keep the box in the shade so that the sun doesn't burn the little plants.\n#Person1#: Is that all?\n#Person2#: No. Later, in a few weeks' time I'll put the little plants in the earth. Then I'll water them to stop the soil from getting too dry. Several weeks after that, I will plant them in rows in the field.\n#Person1#: Do you have to feed plants like you feed chickens? Or do they grow up by themselves?\n#Person2#: In fact they grow better if you feed them. When the plants are in the ground I'll put some powder on the soil. The powder is made from fish, blood and bones. It'll make the cabbage plants grow big and strong.\n#Person1#: Like me!
#Person1#: I want to buy some meat. \n#Person2#: What kind would you like? \n#Person1#: I want one pound of ground beef. \n#Person2#: That's going to be about $2. 48. \n#Person1#: That will be fine. \n#Person2#: What else can I get for you? \n#Person1#: Let me also have three pounds of chicken breasts. \n#Person2#: That's going to be $4. 05 a pound. \n#Person1#: Can you tell me the total cost of the chicken breasts? \n#Person2#: That will be $12. 15. \n#Person1#: That's all I'm going to get today. \n#Person2#: That's fine. Let me get your meat. 
#Person1#: Good afternoon, Mrs. Brown. I've come to see Mr. Brown. \n#Person2#: Good afternoon, Mr. Green. \n#Person1#: Is he in? \n#Person2#: I'm sorry, but he's not in, he's gone out on business. \n#Person1#: Oh! I just drop in on him for a chat. \n#Person2#: Please come in for a cup of coffee. \n#Person1#: No, thank you. Please tell him to phone me when he comes back. 
#Person1#: Morning, Bob. Fancy meeting you here! \n#Person2#: Morning, Jenny. Haven't seen you for ages! \n#Person1#: Well, I thought I'd come to see you, so here I am. \n#Person2#: You did give me a surprise. How have you been? \n#Person1#: Fine, just fine. And you? \n#Person2#: Not so well. I've come down with the flu. \n#Person1#: I'm sorry to hear that. Take care of yourself. \n#Person2#: It's really great to see you again. How about a drink tonight? \n#Person1#: Sounds wonderful. When shall we make it? \n#Person2#: How about seven? \n#Person1#: OK. \n#Person2#: I'll pick you up. \n#Person1#: Thank you. 
#Person1#: I heard Tom was caught stealing something again in the supermarket. \n#Person2#: Really? He deserves it! They should teach him a good lesson. \n#Person1#: But the word is his brother would go bail for him. Last time it's his father who went bail for him. \n#Person2#: Then he is really lucky. 
#Person1#: Are you feeling better today, Bill? \n#Person2#: Well, it's hard to say. I cough a lot in the evening. \n#Person1#: You'd better give up smoking. It's bad for your health. \n#Person2#: You're right, but you know, it's hard to give up an old habit. \n#Person1#: But you should make up your mind first. \n#Person2#: You know, I often have to work til late at night. I need something to keep me awake. \n#Person1#: Why don't you go to bed and get up early? You'll have the same time for work. \n#Person2#: Thank you for your advice! I'll try it. 
#Person1#: What would you have for dessert? \n#Person2#: Well, what do you have? \n#Person1#: Cakes, fruits and ice cream \n#Person2#: Give me ice cream and cake. \n#Person3#: I will have cake and fruits \n#Person1#: Ok. thanks. and which would you liket to drink, coffee or tea? \n#Person2#: I prefer tea. \n#Person3#: I want coffee. \n#Person2#: Thank you. \n#Person1#: Thank you, please wait a minute. \n#Person2#: Well, Waiter, give me the bill, please. \n#Person1#: 32 dollars, sir. \n#Person2#: Here's 35, keep the change. \n#Person1#: Thank you very much sir, please come agian. \n#Person3#: It's a nice restaurant, thank you for the dinner. \n#Person2#: You are welcome. 
#Person1#: Hello, Jim. Looking forward to seeing you. It's not a bad journey, really.\n#Person2#: But what do I do when there? How can I get to your place?\n#Person1#: Don't worry. When you get to Waterloo, take the underground to Regents Park. I'll meet you there at the gate, which will be obvious when you get there. You can't miss it. By the way, when are you leaving?\n#Person2#: I am ready now. I'll get the... the 1138, a southern train, I think it is. That's non-stop to Waterloo and do I get the underground there?\n#Person1#: That's it. You will go straight there on the underground. You want the Bakerloo line to Regents Park. It's only about 4 stops. Make sure you get a northern underground though. You want northern Bakerloo, OK?\n#Person2#: OK, I'll be there soon.\n#Person1#: Oh, by the way, I'll be with Tom. We're going to play badminton later at the college badminton club. Hey, would you like to join the club? Its gym is modern and quite bright and it has some great special services for members. Oh, if you want to catch your train, you'd better go now. It must be nearly 11:30 already.\n#Person2#: Wow, you're right and it's just after half past. I didn't realize it was so late. I have less than 10 minutes. I better take my bag right now and run. See you around 12:30. Bye.\n#Person1#: Bye.
#Person1#: Hello?\n#Person2#: Hello, I'm a local student and I'm reading about the flat that you posted on the website. Is it still available?\n#Person1#: Yes, it is.\n#Person2#: How about the rent? Do you want the rent weekly or monthly?\n#Person1#: The rent is 50 a week and you have to pay weekly on Mondays.\n#Person2#: OK. Is it near public transport?\n#Person1#: Oh, yes, it's only 5 minutes walk to the underground station.\n#Person2#: Great. May I come over to see it tomorrow afternoon at about 3:00 pm?\n#Person1#: Sure. See you tomorrow.\n#Person2#: See you.
#Person1#: Hello, it's Emma McDonald here, from AB electronics. I'd like to book a room for the twenty-fifth, please.\n#Person2#: Certainly, would you like a single or a double room?\n#Person1#: A room for 3, please.\n#Person2#: The rooms for 3 are $150 per night, including breakfast.\n#Person1#: Oh, I see, but my company uses the hotel regularly. We normally get a discount.\n#Person2#: Oh sorry, that will be $100 per night, then. $120 with breakfast.\n#Person1#: Oh, I don't want breakfast.
#Person1#: Hey Roy. I've been thinking for a long time.\n#Person2#: Oh yeah. About what, Cindy?\n#Person1#: About the future. About what I want to be.\n#Person2#: Em, I'm sure there are a lot of things that you can do, like doctor, professor, hostess.\n#Person1#: Em, maybe. I'd like a job in which I can often travel.\n#Person2#: Well, what about being an air hostess? You could travel a lot.\n#Person1#: No, I've thought of that. Air hostess worked really hard. It's so tiring. In planes aren't safe nowadays. They make crash because of bad weather or even be used as weapons if they fall into the wrong hands.\n#Person2#: How about being an interpreter? You are really good at languages. And you could travel to international meetings.\n#Person1#: No, I don't think so. Interpreting didn't sound interesting to me.\n#Person2#: Well, what are you interested in?\n#Person1#: Well, maybe I'll become an international business woman. It's so challenging.\n#Person2#: But you don't like thinking about money?\n#Person1#: Well, I could change.\n#Person2#: Em, I don't know. Cindy, I just don't see you as a business person.
#Person1#: How long have you played the piano? You're great.\n#Person2#: Thanks, I've been playing since I was 9 and now I'm 17. I have to practice for 2 hours every day, but I love it.\n#Person1#: That's good. Since you do it so much, I wouldn't be able to sit still that long. Why do you like it?\n#Person2#: Well, now that I have more experience I write my own music. I feel creative and I enjoy making people happy as they listen to me.\n#Person1#: That's cool. I feel that way when I play soccer. When I play I feel good about using my skills and people like to watch me, you know what I mean?\n#Person2#: Exactly.
#Person1#: Good morning, Mister Thompson. My name is Mary Brown.\n#Person2#: Good morning, Miss Brown, take a seat please.\n#Person1#: Thank you.\n#Person2#: Well Miss Brown, could you please tell me about yourself?\n#Person1#: Yes, of course. I'm 18 years old and just graduated from Peterson Secretary school. I read your ad. in the newspaper and I know that you're looking for a secretary.\n#Person2#: Could you please tell me what you can do?\n#Person1#: I can do whatever a secretary is expected to do, such as typing receiving phone calls, sending faxes or writing reports.\n#Person2#: Well, it seems that your qualifications for the job are excellent. Could you tell me what kind of salary you're expecting?\n#Person1#: I saw in the ad. that this position offers a salary of around $800 a month.\n#Person2#: That's right.\n#Person1#: That would be fine with me.\n#Person2#: Is there anything you would like to know about the job?\n#Person1#: No, not so far.\n#Person2#: Good. Thank you for coming Miss Brown. I've enjoyed meeting and talking with you, we'll let you know the result as early as possible.\n#Person1#: I appreciate the time you have given me.
#Person1#: Hello, I'm calling about the apartment you advertised.\n#Person2#: Yes. What kind of apartments are you interested in?\n#Person1#: I'm interested in a one bedroom, do you have any available?\n#Person2#: Yes, I have one. When do you need it?\n#Person1#: Sometime around next week. How much is the rent?\n#Person2#: Well, the rent is $650, with a $300 security deposit. Gas and water are included, but you pay for electricity.\n#Person1#: Sounds good. May I come over tomorrow to take a look?\n#Person2#: Sure, what time would you like to come?\n#Person1#: How about 10:00 AM?\n#Person2#: Good. May I have your name, please?\n#Person1#: My name is Blanca.\n#Person2#: Blanca, I'll see you tomorrow.
#Person1#: Hey Linda, did you get that letter about the new options for food service next year?\n#Person2#: Not yet, are there a lot of changes?\n#Person1#: There sure are, instead of paying one feet to cover all meals for the whole school year. We are now able to choose how many meals a week we want, and can contract just for that amount. We still have to pay the whole year at the beginning, but we can choose to buy 7, 10, 14 or 21 meals per week. They give you a card with a number of meals you get each week marked on it.\n#Person2#: That's a big change Tom, and a complicated system.\n#Person1#: Yeah, but it will be much better for people who don't eat 3 meals a day 7 days a week in the cafeteria, because they don't have to pay for meals they don't eat.\n#Person2#: So, what's the deal for those who do eat at school all the time?\n#Person1#: It better for them, too, because the more meals you contract for, the cheaper each one is.\n#Person2#: I see, it still sounds rather complicated.\n#Person1#: True, it took me several hours to figure it out. I decided to go with the 10 meal plan.\n#Person2#: Why is that?\n#Person1#: Well, I never eat breakfast and I often go away on weekends, so the 10 meal plan gives me lunch and dinner every weekday at a fairly low price, and I won't be paying for meals I don't usually eat.
#Person1#: Good morning. Mrs.Smith.\n#Person2#: Good morning! Can you help me, please? I'm looking for some books for my mother.\n#Person1#: Well, what kind of books does she like?\n#Person2#: She's very fond of detective stories?\n#Person1#: I see. Has she read any detective stories?\n#Person2#: Oh, yes!\n#Person1#: Do you know if she's read this one?\n#Person2#: I'm not sure, but she probably won't remember if she has! She's very forgetful!\n#Person1#: Ah! She has a bad memory. How old is she?\n#Person2#: She's eighty-seven.\n#Person1#: I suggest you take this book.It ' s very exciting.\n#Person2#: Thank you.That' s a good idea.she likes exciting books. Can you suggest another one?
#Person1#: Hey, Jimmy, you've been sitting in front of the TV all day. Anything interesting on TV?\n#Person2#: Not really. Quite boring right now, actually. Mostly infomercials and public service announcements.\n#Person1#: Why don't you turn off the TV and get outside? You need to get some fresh air.\n#Person2#: I know, I know.But my favorite show is on in a couple of minutes. It's the series finals, and I wouldn't miss it for the world!\n#Person1#: Really? What's the series about?\n#Person2#: Well, it's about how an immigrant girl achieve her dream in America. It's a sitcom but really quite smart and really funny. I think you'd like it.\n#Person1#: It sounds interesting, but I am not a big fan of TV shows. They're time consuming and don't have much depth.\n#Person2#: I believe some shows are quite informative and interesting. Take this show for example, it examines American xenophobia and how it might conflict with the American dream, with hilarious results.\n#Person1#: Really? that's interesting!\n#Person2#: Yeah.Oh, here it comes! why don't we watch it together? they are going to have a court debate in this episode. It should be good.\n#Person1#: OK, I'll give it a go.

#Person1#: May I help you?\n#Person2#: Give me a Big Mac, a small order of French fries and a medium Coke.\n#Person1#: You'll need to wait a few minutes for the fries. They are still in the fryer.\n#Person2#: That's fine.\n#Person1#: Your total comes to $ 7.\n#Person2#: Here's a twenty. Could you give me some more napkins?\n#Person1#: Sure. Your cash back is $ 13. And we'll bring out your fries in two minutes.\n#Person2#: Thanks.
#Person1#: You'v been work here for nearly a month, how do you feel about the job?\n#Person2#: Not bad. Thank you for your help. I am always busy with this job, I feel a bit tired.\n#Person1#: I had the same feeling when I first came to work here. but after a period of time, I feel better, I am sure you'll get used to this busy job.\n#Person2#: I also feel that work efficiency here is very high. and you have strong working ability and professional skill, it seems that you know all, that's really wonderful!\n#Person1#: You know the phrase the survival of the fittest.

( after a while ) Done.\n#Person2#: Not bad. Okay, now take some meat and potatoes from the fridge.\n#Person1#: How many potatoes do you need?\n#Person2#: Three. And bring four bell peppers.\n#Person1#: Gotcha. . . OK. Here they are.\n#Person2#: Now wash them, then dice the potatoes and bell peppers.\n#Person1#: Where's the peeler?

I can't stand it.\n#Person1#: Have you taken a walk around your neighborhood yet?\n#Person2#: Unfortunately, yes.\n#Person1#: What do you mean by that?\n#Person2#: I took a long walk through the neighborhood this morning on my way to the train station. It took me 20 minutes.\n#Person1#: Yes, but you only pay 800 dollars a month. Emm, it's hard to decide which is better, shorter commuting time or lower rent.\n#Person2#: I thought paying a lower rent would be better, but now I'm not sure.\n#Person1#: Is there a supermarket nearby?\n#Person2#: Yes, if you consider 7-11 is a supermarket.\n#Person1#: Sounds like you better buy a bicycle.\n#Person2#: That's right, or I'm going to spend a lot of time walking.
#Person1#: I hear you're moving to New York.\n#Person2#: Yes, I found a very good job down there.\n#Person1#: Well, we'll certainly miss you in Boston.\n#Person2#: I'm going to miss you folks, too.\n#Person1#: Let's keep in touch.\n#Person2#: OK. I'll drop you a line as soon as I get there.
#Person1#: Alice, I never knew you had such a lovely voice. You really can sing, can't you?\n#Person2#: Thanks, Mark. I used to be a member of the school choir.\n#Person1#: No wonder you can control your voice so well. You are a professional singer.\n#Person2#: Well, you are flattering me.

What's John going to do this summer?\n#Person2#: I think he's going to the mountains with his parents.\n#Person1#: Well, so long, Mary. Have fun.\n#Person2#: You too, Peter. Give my regards to John. I'll see you in September.

I think they left them cooking too long.\n#Person1#: The food here is usually good, so I think that we should tell the waiter that there is a problem.\n#Person2#: I think that you are right. Maybe they can give us a free dessert or something.

#Person1#: Which kind of sport do you like to watch?\n#Person2#: Basketball, football, table tennis. I will watch them on TV.\n#Person1#: So you must like NBA game.\n#Person2#: Yeah, it is my favorite. Many Chinese people including women and children would like to concern the game.

What about you?\n#Person1#: I prefer the indoor sports, such as bowling, badminton and squash.\n#Person2#: Moderate exercise is really important for health. 'Life lies in movement.

That's my strongest personality.\n#Person1#: What are your strengths and weaknesses?\n#Person2#: Em, as I have said, I'm diligent and industrious. On the other hand, sometimes I'm too hard-working and I put myself under too much pressure to make things perfect.\n#Person1#: What qualities would you expect of persons working as a team?\n#Person2#: To work in a team, in my opinion, two characteristics are necessary for a person. That is, the person must be cooperative and aggressive.\n#Person1#: How do you spend your leisure time?\n#Person2#: I like playing games and having sports. They are my favourite hobbies.\n#Person1#: So, what kind of sport do you like most?\n#Person2#: Oh, it's hard to narrow it down to just one. I mean, I like all kinds of sports, basketball, swimming, bike riding and so on. Maybe it is just the reason why I am so energetic and vigorous.
#Person1#: What does Human Resources Department do?\n#Person2#: Hiring, firing, training, insurances, benefits, retirement plans, salary, vacation.\n#Person1#: They take care of a lot of things.\n#Person2#: But most of time, they provide assistances.\n#Person1#: What do you mean?\n#Person2#: Say if the Engineering Department wants to hire a person, they will request HR to find candidates.\n#Person1#: Yes?\n#Person2#: The Engineering Manager and his team will interview the candidates. HR will also be involved with the interview, but basically arranging the schedule and explaining the benefits.\n#Person1#: OK.\n#Person2#: Then the Engineering Manager will choose the candidate.\n#Person1#: I see.

Can your mechanics repair it?\n#Person2#: Well, they're trying to repair it, sir. But to tell you the truth, you need a new car.
#Person1#: Hey, Michael. Remember me? I'm Becky. We used to work at Lemans together.\n#Person2#: Oh, sure. How are you? Long time no see. How are things at Lemans?\n#Person1#: It's about the same. I've been thinking of making a change myself. Do you mind if I ask you a few things about your job at the university?\n#Person2#: No, not at all. Go ahead.\n#Person1#: Well, I was wondering what the salaries are like? I mean. . . are they much lower than the corporate world?\n#Person2#: Well, I can't speak for all universities, but my salary is a definitely lower than at Lemans. I just don't think the salaries are comparable when you leave a major corporation.\n#Person1#: Yeah, that's what I thought. But, I've heard that the perks are better. I was wondering if that was really true.\n#Person2#: I'd have to say yes and no on that. I don't get a big end-of-the-year bonus like I did at Lemans but I get to take classes for free if I want to. I've always wanted to get a graduate degree so I'm taking classes now to do that.\n#Person1#: Oh, that's great. It sounds like you're really happy with your move.\n#Person2#: Yeah, I guess I am. Working at a university is really suits me.
#Person1#: This facility is great, don't you think?\n#Person2#: Yes, it is better than last year. They have done a very good job this time.\n#Person1#: I'm glad our booth is on the first floor. More people can see our display.\n#Person2#: If someone wants to find us, they can look at this floor plan. It shows where all the companies have their booths.\n#Person1#: Let me see that. I didn't get one when I came in.\n#Person2#: Really? They didn't give you one with your ticket?\n#Person1#: No.\n#Person2#: That's strange.\n#Person1#: Where do you go for lunch around here?\n#Person2#: Are you hungry?\n#Person1#: Not too bad. But I will be soon.\n#Person2#: I went across the street. There is a good Chinese restaurant next to the hotel.\n#Person1#: I can't see Cortex on this floor plan. Don't they have a booth here?\n#Person2#: They must. Let me look at that. Here it is. Cortex. It's on the second floor, next to the Roll booth.\n#Person1#: Oh, that will be uncomfortable for them.\n#Person2#: For whom? Cortex?\n#Person1#: Yes. Cortex just stole Darren McDowell from Rolly. And probably Darren will be here. So he will have to spend the whole show standing next to his old Cortex coworkers.\n#Person2#: I've never met Darren. But you're right. That would probably be uncomfortable.\n#Person1#: When you reserve a booth, you should check who your neighbors will be. Don't you think?\n#Person2#: Yes, maybe. If you're Darren McDowell, you should probably check.\n#Person1#: Yes. Well, I think I'll go get lunch. Will you join me?\n#Person2#: No, I'll stay here at the booth. I ate earlier. Are you going to the Chinese restaurant?\n#Person1#: Maybe. I will look around.
#Person1#: Would you like me to help you on your new project?\n#Person2#: I would love the help! Would you prefer helping with the writing part or is programming more your thing?\n#Person1#: I would enjoy helping with the writing portion.\n#Person2#: Perfect! You'll be working alone on that portion. Do you like to work alone?\n#Person1#: That is OK sometimes.\n#Person2#: Our first meeting is next Monday. Could you meet with us at that time?\n#Person1#: No, I can't be there.\n#Person2#: Please send me your background information before the meeting so I can look at it.\n#Person1#: I can send that information to you.\n#Person2#: OK. I look forward to working with you. Enjoy your week!
#Person1#: Well, that was an interesting documentary!\n#Person2#: For sure! I didn't really understand some of the technical jargon they used in the film when they talked about social security in the US.\n#Person1#: Like what?\n#Person2#: Well, they mentioned how people put away money in something called a 401K?\n#Person1#: Yeah, I know it sounds weird, but a 401k is a type of retirement plan that allows employees to save and invest for their own retirement. Through a you can authorize your employer to deduct a certain amount of money from your paycheck and invest it in the plan. Everyone tries to contribute as much as possible so that when you retire, you can rest peacefully on your nest egg.\n#Person2#: That's interesting and logical I guess. In my country, we also have to contribute to a government-run retirement fund, but most people don't really trust it so they just invest in properties or things like that.\n#Person1#: That seems a bit unstable don't you think?\n#Person2#: Yeah, but corrupt governments in the past have created distrust among banks and financial institutions, so now people prefer to have money hidden in a jar or a piggy bank.\n#Person1#: I'Ve been thinking of doing that lately! I don't want some banker to run off with my money!
#Person1#: I am sorry for damaging your car, sir.\n#Person2#: Don't worry about it. Just leave it to the insurance companies.\n#Person1#: The car park in this community is over crowded, isn't it?\n#Person2#: Yeah, more and more cars. People should try to take public transportation.\n#Person1#: There aren't enough buses in this city, are there?\n#Person2#: Yeah, sometimes I really feel like writing a letter to the mayor.\n#Person1#: That's too much of hassle. We just want a little bigger parking space.\n#Person2#: Have you taken this to the property management, yet?\n#Person1#: No. but I'm gonna. You know, several months ago, I backed into red Honda when parking.\n#Person2#: Where? On the road?\n#Person1#: No, right here in the parking lot. It was parked right here in your space. The left rearview mirror was smashed.\n#Person2#: Is the car owner a lady with deafening voice?\n#Person1#: Yes! How do you know that?\n#Person2#: That's my wife!
#Person1#: What do you consider to be your strong points?\n#Person2#: I think I'm tough not only physically but mentally.\n#Person1#: Why do you say that?\n#Person2#: I have been playing football since high school. At present, I'm a member of a community football club.\n#Person1#: Really? Are you still playing?\n#Person2#: Yes. I practice every weekend with my teammates.\n#Person1#: I see. You must be tough.\n#Person2#: I never get tired. I think this comes from practicing football.\n#Person1#: What do you consider to be your weak points?\n#Person2#: Frankly speaking, I'm a typical Chinese workaholic. I don't mind working late at night. Due to that, I tend to leave the office late.\n#Person1#: What kind of people are you reluctant to work with?\n#Person2#: So far I haven't met any particular kind. However, I may rule out those who prefer chatting to working.\n#Person1#: Do you prefer to work alone or as part of a team?\n#Person2#: It depends on the type of work. Usually I prefer to work alone, because I'm self-motivated. But I can work either way. If necessary, I don't hesitate to join the team.
#Person1#: Excuse me, does the No. 8 bus go to the Wang Fu Jing Department Store?\n#Person2#: No, it doesn't. You'll have to change to a No. 3 bus at Sha Tan. Or, if you don't mind walking, you can take this bus and get off at the Workers Club Building and walk across to Wang Fu Jing.\n#Person1#: I think I'd rather take the bus. Where did you say I should change?\n#Person2#: Sha Tan, when you get off the bus, walk back to the corner and turn left, you'll see the bus stop just ahead of you on the left-hand side of the street. But remember to take the No. 3 bus. The others don't go to Wang Fu Jing.\n#Person1#: Change to the No. 3 bus at Sha Tan. Thanks a lot.\n#Person2#: Not at all.
#Person1#: There are so many people in your house. What are they doing?\n#Person2#: We are having a party. I am the host and my wife is the hostess.\n#Person1#: Are they your guests?\n#Person2#: Yes, they are. They are all my friends.\n#Person1#: Who is that man?\n#Person2#: He is Professor Zhang. He is a Chinese teacher. His wife is a teacher, too. Their daughter is a college student.\n#Person1#: Who is that young man?\n#Person2#: He is her boyfriend. He is a young doctor. His name is Karl Black.
#Person1#: What do you think of this brown coffee table?\n#Person2#: It's nice, but it doesn't match the color of our room.\n#Person1#: How about this?\n#Person2#: Oh no, this type of coffee table gets dirty very easily and it's difficult to clean.\n#Person1#: And you are really difficult to please. All right, let's look at some others.\n#Person2#: Look, this one matches our room and it's inexpensive. Don't you think so?\n#Person1#: Moreover, it's easy to clean, right? You are really lazy.\n#Person2#: I only want to save you the trouble of looking after me.\n#Person1#: Sounds ridiculous!
#Person1#: This is Officer Belford. You reported a break-in just now?\n#Person2#: Yes, I did.\n#Person1#: I'll need a little more information about it.\n#Person2#: Just the facts.\n#Person1#: What time did it happen?\n#Person2#: It must have been sometime between 12:00 and 1:30 because I was home until almost 12:00 and I just got back at 1:30.\n#Person1#: What did they get?\n#Person2#: Well, what I know now is some jewellery and the television.\n#Person1#: OK. Good, you're making a list. By the way, did you have your belongings marked?\n#Person2#: Yes. My husband put his name on the TV.\n#Person1#: By the way, where is your husband?\n#Person2#: He's on a trip to Canada. And I haven't told him about the robbery.\n#Person1#: I see, where did you put your jewellery?\n#Person2#: I put it in the refrigerator. But all my good jewellery is in the safe box in the bank.\n#Person1#: OK. I'll be in touch with you as soon as we have found anything about it.
#Person1#: Dr. Carter's Office.\n#Person2#: Yes, I'd like to make an appointment to see Dr. Carter, please.\n#Person1#: Is this your first visit?\n#Person2#: Yes it is.\n#Person1#: Okay. Could I have your name please?\n#Person2#: Yes. My name is Ronald Schuller.\n#Person1#: And may I ask who referred you to our office?\n#Person2#: Uh, I drove past your office yesterday.\n#Person1#: Okay. How about the day after tomorrow on Wednesday at 4:00 O'clock?\n#Person2#: Uh. Do you happen to have an opening in the morning? I usually pick up my kids from school around that time.\n#Person1#: Okay. Um ... how about Tuesday at 8:00 A.M. or Thursday at 8:15 A.M.?\n#Person2#: Uh, do you have anything earlier, like 7:30?\n#Person1#: No. I'm sorry.\n#Person2#: Well, in that case, Thursday would be fine.\n#Person1#: Okay. Could I have your phone number please?\n#Person2#: It's 643-0547.\n#Person1#: Alright. And what's the nature of your visit?\n#Person2#: Uh ...\n#Person1#: Yes sir.\n#Person2#: Well, to tell the truth, I fell from a ladder two days ago while painting my house, and I sprained my ankle when my foot landed in a paint can. I suffered a few scratches on my hands and knees, but I'm most concerned that the swelling in my ankle hasn't gone down yet.\n#Person1#: Well, did you put ice on it immediately after this happened?\n#Person2#: Well yeah. I just filled the paint can with ice and ...\n#Person1#: And so after you removed the paint can ... Sir, sir, Mr. Schuller, are you still there?\n#Person2#: Well that's part of the problem. Uh, the paint can is still on my foot.\n#Person1#: Look, Mr. Schuller. Please come in today. I don't think your case can wait.
#Person1#: Oh, we still haven't decided what to get him.\n#Person2#: I know. It's hard. What does he need?\n#Person1#: Well, darling, the other day he said that he needed a car.\n#Person2#: Yeah, right. Well, I think that's a little beyond us.\n#Person1#: Yeah, it'd be fun, but it's just a little too expensive.\n#Person2#: There's the usual kind of thing, like a wallet or tie.\n#Person1#: Oh, please, not for his sixtieth. I think we should get him something more expensive than that, don't you? I mean, we want to get something good, something...\n#Person2#: Something unusual?\n#Person1#: Yeah.\n#Person2#: Well, how about a computer? We could get him a computer. That way we could keep in touch on email.\n#Person1#: No, no, no. You know him. He says he's too old to learn how to use a computer. He isn't, of course, but I don't think he'd ever use it.
#Person1#: Hey Taxi! Ah great. Thanks for pulling over.\n#Person2#: Where to?\n#Person1#: Well, I'm going to the National Museum of Art, and ....\n#Person2#: Sure. Hop in. No problem. Hang on!\n#Person1#: Uh. Excuse me. How long does it take to get there?\n#Person2#: Well, that all depends on the traffic, but it shouldn't take more than twenty minutes for the average driver. [Oh]. And I'm not average. I have driving down to an art, so we should be able to cruise through traffic and get there in less than fifteen minutes.\n#Person1#: Okay. Uh, sorry for asking [Yeah?], but do you have any idea how much the fare will be?\n#Person2#: Oh, it shouldn't be more than 18 dollars ... not including a ... uh-hum ... a tip of course.\n#Person1#: Oh, and by the way, do you know what time the museum closes?\n#Person2#: Well, I would guess around 6:00 O'clock.\n#Person1#: Uh, do you have the time?\n#Person2#: Yeah. It's half past four. [Thanks] Uh, this IS your first time to the city, right?\n#Person1#: Yeah. How did you know?\n#Person2#: Well, you can tell tourists from a mile away in this city because they walk down the street looking straight up at the skyscrapers.\n#Person1#: Was it that obvious?\n#Person2#: Well ...\n#Person1#: Oh, before I forget, can you recommend any good restaurants downtown that offer meals at a reasonable price?\n#Person2#: Umm ... Well, the Mexican restaurant, La Fajita, is fantastic. [Oh] It's not as inexpensive as other places I know, but the decor is very authentic, [Okay] and the portions are larger than most places I've been to.\n#Person1#: Sounds great! How do I get there from the museum?\n#Person2#: Well, you can catch the subway right outside the museum. There are buses that run that way, but you would have to transfer a couple of times. And there are taxis too, but they don't run by the museum that often.\n#Person1#: Okay. Thanks.
#Person1#: Miguel, why haven't you finished your science homework all week?\n#Person2#: I'm sorry, Ms. Perry. My house burned down last weekend. My family and I have been sleeping at my grandma's all week. I'm very stressed. I can't do my homework because my grandma's house is so loud and I lost my textbook.\n#Person1#: Oh, no! Let's talk more about it during lunch. Can you come to my office then?\n#Person2#: Yes, but I might be a little late. My grandma's kitchen is too small to make food, so I need to buy lunch.
#Person1#: Happy birthday, Jimmy. Are you ready for the next present?\n#Person2#: You mean there's more besides the watch?\n#Person1#: Come with us. It's in the car. Now, here we are. You've been talking about this for months.\n#Person2#: Oh, it's a new computer. It's just what I want. I'm so happy about it. Thank you so much, Mum and Dad.
#Person1#: Hello, Lucy. When are you going off to Beijing?\n#Person2#: This evening.\n#Person1#: How are you getting there, by air or by train?\n#Person2#: By train. It leaves at 5:00 and arrives in Beijing at 7:10 tomorrow morning.\n#Person1#: Oh, only 14 hours. Is anybody seeing you off this evening?\n#Person2#: Yes, my parents are going with me to the station to see me off.\n#Person1#: That's good! How long are you staying in Beijing for your holiday?\n#Person2#: Only four days. Well, I must be off now. See you when I get back.\n#Person1#: OK. Good luck and have a good trip!\n#Person2#: Thanks. Goodbye!
#Person1#: Hello there, welcome to Wine World. Let me know if I can help you out at all. \n#Person2#: Um, yes, please, I could really use some help. I'm going over to my boss'house for dinner tonight and don't know what kind of wine I should bring. \n#Person1#: OK, do you know what kind of food will be served? \n#Person2#: Well, his wife is Japanese. He said she makes really good sushi. \n#Person1#: Hmm, that's a bit of a challenge. Sushi is notoriously difficult to pair with wine. Well, let's see. have to be a white wine, of course. \n#Person2#: Why? Wouldn't a red wine go well with sushi? \n#Person1#: No, I don't think so. Sushi is a very delicately flavored food, and red wine would be a jarring contrast. You need a white wine, which has more subtle flavors, to complement the fish. \n#Person2#: I see. So should I get a bottle of Chardonnay? That's a white wine, right? \n#Person1#: Yes, Chardonnay is a white wine, but I'm not sure it'd be your best bet. Chardonnay is one of the more fullbodied whites, and tends to be a bit oaky. I'd suggest that you go for something brighter, like this Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand. \n#Person2#: Sauvignon Blanc? What's that? \n#Person1#: That's another varietal, or type of grape, just like Chardonnay. \n#Person2#: Let's see. The label says it's got 'attractive citrus and grassy aromas that give way to crisp, mineral flavors and a bonedry finish. Serve chilled. ' Oh, no, how long will it take to chill the wine? I'm on my way to the dinner now. \n#Person1#: It's OK, don't worry, we'll just choose a wine from the cooler. We don't have quite as extensive a selection over here, but. . . this Rhone Valley white would be lovely. \n#Person2#: All right. What varietal is that? \n#Person1#: Well, this is a French wine, so they don't always specify the varietal on the label. The French believe that the soil a grape is grown in is one of the most important factors in the final flavor of the wine. This wine is probably a blend of a few different types of grapes, mostly Viognier, I'd guess. \n#Person2#: And you think this is a good wine? \n#Person1#: Yes, this is one of our best-sellers. It's not quite as dry as the Sauvignon Blanc we were looking at earlier, which means it's more approachable. It's light and crisp, with a bit of a vanilla aroma. \n#Person2#: Perfect! I'll take it! 
#Person1#: Where's Bill? The ambassador is already here. The meeting is set to start at 9 am. \n#Person2#: He's late again. Traffic is probably holding him up. You know, he commutes from the suburbs. It's not easy commuting every day. We should cut him some slack. \n#Person1#: Even though the trafic is bumper-to-bumper out there, I don't think it's heavy traffic that makes Bill late. He takes the train, remember? \n#Person2#: Oh, that's right. Well, the train shouldn't be late. That means there is only one explanation. . . . Bill must have overslept. \n#Person1#: Well, to be fare, since he's coming all the way from Lancaster, he's got to get up much earlier than the rest of us. He must get start on his commute about six thirty, no telling what time he actually gets up. \n#Person2#: That's right, because he's got to get to the train station from his house, then take the blue line into the city, then switch trains to the red line. In all, the trip's got to take more than 2 hours. \n#Person1#: Why doesn't he just drive to work? \n#Person2#: It's too difficult to park your car in the city. Also, the traffic coming in from the suburbs is a nightmare. 
#Person1#: Hi, Mike, what gives? \n#Person2#: Hi, Bill, this is my new car. \n#Person1#: Hey, great set of wheels. \n#Person2#: You like it, huh? \n#Person1#: Who wouldn't? Wow, that's out of this world. \n#Person2#: It is special, isn't it? \n#Person1#: Yeah, too cool. How much did they sold you for? \n#Person2#: Lots. Looks like I'll have to moonlight for the next two years. \n#Person1#: I can imagine. \n#Person2#: Hey, let's go for a spin. You can try it out. \n#Person1#: I'd love to. \n#Person2#: Ok, let's go. 
#Person1#: Sally, I'm tired of this Western food. I really miss my mother's Sichuan cooking. \n#Person2#: I'm sure you do miss that type of cooking. But can't you try to get used to Western food? \n#Person1#: I have tried. But Americans like butter, bread, sugar, and cream too much. \n#Person2#: I suppose you're right, Lee. Maybe that's why so many Westerners are overweight. \n#Person1#: It's interesting that Americans work very hard at their jobs, do not take naps during the day, and yet they can be so heavy. \n#Person2#: You see, because we are often busy working, we eat too much fast food, and that food is very fattening. 
#Person1#: Dutton Hotels. How may I help you today? \n#Person2#: I wanted to check rates and availability for your San Francisco location. \n#Person1#: Certainly, I can help you with that. Will that be the downtown or waterfront location? \n#Person2#: The waterfront location. \n#Person1#: What date do you plan to check in? \n#Person2#: I'd like to check in on October 12th and check out the 15th. \n#Person1#: Okay, let me see what we have. For how many? \n#Person2#: One. And, if possible, I'm looking for a non-smoking room. \n#Person1#: Sure, we have a non-smoking queen with an ocean view for $189 or a standard room with a courtyard view for $139 a night. \n#Person2#: I'd like to book the standard room. \n#Person1#: Okay, your last name? \n#Person2#: Rama. \n#Person1#: And, your first name? \n#Person2#: Jeff. \n#Person1#: Okay, I have you booked in a standard non-smoking queen, checking in on October 12th and departing the 15th. What major credit card would you like to use to guarantee the reservation? \n#Person2#: A Visa. \n#Person1#: The number and expiration? \n#Person2#: It's 7388-2424-3535-1818 and the expiration is 05/08. \n#Person1#: Your confirmation number is PD672. Is there anything else I help you with? \n#Person2#: No, that's all. Thanks. \n#Person1#: Have a nice day and thanks you for calling Dutton Hotels. 
#Person1#: Lily, how long have you been here?\n#Person2#: I came to China in June, so it has been 7 months.\n#Person1#: Wow, that's a long time. But you haven't spent Spring Festival in China yet, right?\n#Person2#: That's right, but I am going to stay in China this year to see how Chinese people spend their most important festival. In fact, I'm doing a business research about Spring Festival for my company.\n#Person1#: Really? Maybe you can come to spend it with my family.\n#Person2#: Can I?\n#Person1#: My parents would be happy to have you. You will love it. Though we live downtown, we always spend Spring Festival in our hometown.\n#Person2#: You mean in the countryside?\n#Person1#: Yes, I believe you will learn a lot about Chinese culture this winter holiday. We will have a big family meal and eat things like fish and dumplings, and we give children lucky money in red envelopes.\n#Person2#: That sounds interesting. I can't wait!
#Person1#: Who do you work for at the moment?\n#Person2#: Um, I work for the BBC World Service. I've been with the BBC for 5 years. Before that, I worked as an interpreter for the EU.\n#Person1#: As you know this job is based in Geneva. Have you ever lived abroad before?\n#Person2#: Oh, yes, I have. In fact I was born in Argentina and I lived there until I was 11.\n#Person1#: That's interesting, have you traveled much?\n#Person2#: Oh, yes. I've been to all over Europe and many parts of South America.\n#Person1#: Why did you go to these places?\n#Person2#: Well, mostly for pleasure. But 3 years ago, I went back to Argentina to cover various political stories in Buenos Aires for the BBC.
#Person1#: What color should we paint this room, honey?\n#Person2#: How about red?\n#Person1#: Red in the dining room? No way.\n#Person2#: Why not? I think red is a great color for a wall.\n#Person1#: But red makes you fat.\n#Person2#: What are you talking about?\n#Person1#: I was reading a magazine article that said warm colors make you want to eat more, blue would be better.\n#Person2#: But I like eating. Let's paint the room red.\n#Person1#: Not a chance.
#Person1#: Liberty Park. Good morning, how can I help you?\n#Person2#: I would like to know more about art festival next week. What can I do at the festival?\n#Person1#: Oh, you can do lots of things! You can listen to music, look at paintings by local and international painters, joined the picnic in the park or watch play.\n#Person2#: Wow! What paintings can I see at the festival?\n#Person1#: There are best, local painters are showing their paintings. Two of them are very traditional and like to paint landscapes. The third local painter is a modern artist and her paintings show the world in a different way - the way she sees it. You can also see new and old paintings from France, Japan, Brazil and Norway.\n#Person2#: When is the art exhibition?\n#Person1#: Oh, there are 2 actually. The local painters will show their paintings at 11:00 AM on Saturday and the international exhibition starts at 3:00 PM on Sunday. Would you like to know where it is?\n#Person2#: Yes, please.\n#Person1#: The local exhibition is in Building 4 and the international exhibition is in Building 8.
#Person1#: My boss told me never to go to work again!\n#Person2#: I can't believe it, why?\n#Person1#: I don't know. What he told me that I was so confused.\n#Person2#: Did you usually go to work late?\n#Person1#: Well, I often did.\n#Person2#: When you were working, did you think about other things?\n#Person1#: Sometimes.\n#Person2#: Could you use a computer?\n#Person1#: No, I can only use a typewriter.\n#Person2#: Well, I think I know why. You didn't use your time well and you didn't learn new things.
#Person1#: The coffee pot is empty. No matter how many signs we post, someone keeps drinking the last cup without making a fresh pot. What's the point of rules if nobody follows them?\n#Person2#: I know. I'm not a coffee drinker, but I'm upset about the microwave. It looks like a bomb went off in there.\n#Person1#: Yeah. Nobody ever cleans up, do they?\n#Person2#: And nobody ever covers their food.\n#Person1#: We should have paper towels next the microwave. People might be better about covering their food if there are paper towels nearby.\n#Person2#: That might work better than these useless signs in the break room. It would be easier for people to clean up after they've heated their food, too.\n#Person1#: I'll tell you one place where signs work: the parking lot.\n#Person2#: That's because the sign warns people they will have to pay a fine if they park in the wrong place.
#Person1#: Do you have any questions?\n#Person2#: Yes, do I have to work a whole year before I can take a vacation?\n#Person1#: Yes, after you ' Ve been here a year, you qualify for a three-day vacation\n#Person2#: Only three days?\n#Person1#: That's the company policy.\n#Person2#: What happens if I use up my sick days before the end of the year? If I ' m sick an extra day or two, will my pay be deducted?\n#Person1#: Yes. That's the company policy.\n#Person2#: It was the same as the last place I worked at. I was hoping you ' d be different.
#Person1#: Hello? This is John Smith. Can I speak to Mr. White, please?\n#Person2#: This is Mr. White speaking.\n#Person1#: Hi. I understand that you have a house for sale, haven ' t you?\n#Person2#: Yes.\n#Person1#: I ' d like to know more about it.\n#Person2#: Can you come to my office this afternoon at 3 o ' clock?\n#Person1#: OK. I will be there.\n#Person2#: Thank you for calling. Goodbye.\n#Person1#: Bye.
#Person1#: Jeff, look at this listing! It says there is a cozy studio apartment for rent, and it's only $ 700 per month. What do you think?\n#Person2#: Well I think I can afford that apartment. But are pets allowed?\n#Person1#: Hmm... let me look. Yes, it says it's a pet-friendly building.\n#Person2#: That's great. That means I can bring my cat, Mr. Twinkles. Where is the apartment located?\n#Person1#: It says it's located in the suburbs.
#Person1#: Good morning, miss.\n#Person2#: Good morning, sir.\n#Person1#: Could you tell me please where can I find a currents exchange?\n#Person2#: Right here, how can i help you today, sir?\n#Person1#: I'd like to exchange 5000 Singapore dollars into the US dollars please.\n#Person2#: Do you have an account this bank, sir?\n#Person1#: Yes, here is my account number.\n#Person2#: May i please see ID?\n#Person1#: Sure, here is my passport, by the way what is the rate today?\n#Person2#: Today's rate is 2. 57 Singapore dollars for 1 US dollar, here is your money, sir.

#Person1#: I'm starving! It would be truly appreciated if you bought me a burrito.\n#Person2#: I'm a little short. I don't have enough for you.\n#Person1#: I'm starving, as I didn't eat yet today.\n#Person2#: I really don't have enough money.\n#Person1#: My stomach feels so empty.\n#Person2#: Well, why don't you ask Bob for some money? I'm hungry too.\n#Person1#: I'll be getting money on Friday, and I'll get it back to you then.\n#Person2#: Okay, so on Friday, you can buy yourself something to eat.\n#Person1#: That's not nice.\n#Person2#: You can always go home and make something to eat.\n#Person1#: I can't go home yet, because I have things to do here.\n#Person2#: Sorry. That's not my fault.
#Person1#: Excuse me. I need to refill this prescription.\n#Person2#: It says on the bottle here that you can have two refills.\n#Person1#: Yes, I need to refill it today.\n#Person2#: Alright. I'm sorry, Miss. According to our file, this prescription has already been refilled twice.\n#Person1#: I was worried about that. I couldn't remember if I had it refilled twice yet or not.\n#Person2#: Well, it looks like you have. You will need to see your doctor to get a new prescription.\n#Person1#: Listen. This is an emergency. I tried to call my doctor, but he is out of town. So I can't see him in time. I need this medicine. It is for skin condition. I've run out. Can you just refill it once more?\n#Person2#: I'm sorry, Miss. We can't do it. We must follow the prescription. And this prescription has run out.\n#Person1#: But I need it. Please. Refill it for me just this once. I can go to the doctor around ten days from now. Then I'll have another prescription.\n#Person2#: Miss, I understand your problem. But it is against the law for us to sell certain medicines without a prescription. It's the law. I can't do anything about it. We never sell medicine unless we have a proper prescription. Never.\n#Person1#: But I have a prescription. I just need more of it.\n#Person2#: A prescription must be valid. It cannot be an expired prescription. I'm sorry, Miss. It's the law. You will have to find another doctor who will prescribe this for you.\n#Person1#: Oh, it will be so expensive! I have a special medical plan, and I can only see one doctor. It will cost me a lot of money to see another doctor.\n#Person2#: Miss, I just can't help you on this. I'm a pharmacist, not a doctor. And there are other customers I need to help now. I know it is frustrating when this happens. But there is nothing I can do about it. I'm sorry.\n#Person1#: This is ridiculous! In Taiwan, it is much easier to get medicine when I need it.\n#Person2#: Maybe that's true. I don't know. But I'm sure in Taiwan you have prescriptions too.
#Person1#: Hey, where's Cindy?\n#Person2#: She told me that she's got tennis practice today.\n#Person1#: You're Mary, right?\n#Person2#: How did you know?\n#Person1#: Cindy told me about you in our gym class.\n#Person2#: I see. Do you live in this neighborhood, too?\n#Person1#: My house is next door to yours.\n#Person2#: Oh, Cindy did mention you before. You're Alexander Newman.\n#Person1#: Just call me Alex. Alex and Alexander are the same thing.
#Person1#: Hi Bob, how's business?\n#Person2#: Just okay.\n#Person1#: Okay, enough small talk. Let's get down to business.\n#Person2#: Good idea.\n#Person1#: Since we're good friends, you don't have to pay me.\n#Person2#: No, I can't accept it. Business is business.
#Person1#: The world changes, the family changes too.\n#Person2#: What do you mean?\n#Person1#: People now like a small family composed of two parents and one child.\n#Person2#: That is called a nuclear family.\n#Person1#: I don't like such a family.\n#Person2#: What kind of family are you like?\n#Person1#: I like a family composed of many people. It includes grandparents, parents, aunts and uncles, and children.\n#Person2#: It's a traditional family. It may be too large to live well.\n#Person1#: We can live well, I think.
#Person1#: John's father got married again.\n#Person2#: Married whom?\n#Person1#: If I tell you. , you must be completely taken aback.\n#Person2#: Come on. Tell me what happened.\n#Person1#: He married a girl who is only eighteen!\n#Person2#: Is that true? But anyhow, it's none of our business, isn't it?
#Person1#: Henry, I want to ask you something.\n#Person2#: Say what you want to say.\n#Person1#: You see. The wage is not paid yet, I am wondering if you could possibly lend me some money.\n#Person2#: I am sorry. But I do not have any money to lend to you.
#Person1#: hi, I'm Lucas, I just moved in next door.\n#Person2#: oh, hi Lucas, come on in. I'm Barbara. Nice to meet you.\n#Person1#: nice to meet you too.\n#Person2#: would you like something to drink? I've got tea and some grape juice.\n#Person1#: thanks. Some tea would be nice. Chinese tea is great. I really like your tea set. Where did you get it?\n#Person2#: oh, there is a supermarket not far from here. But there is also a tea house around the corner, where you can get tea and a tea set as well.\n#Person1#: oh yeah, I saw the tea house the other day. I think I might go and have a look sometime. It's a nice neighborhood here.\n#Person2#: you are right about that. It's quiet and very convenient. You can get to the bus and the subway stations within ten minutes'walk. There's a grocery store, a book store, a gym, and many restaurants\n#Person1#: there's a gym nearby? That's exciting! I really want to start to go to gym as soon as possible. I've been lazy this summer holiday and have put on some weight.\n#Person2#: well, if you want we can go together sometime. Actually I was thinking of going this afternoon, if you like, you can join me and I can show you the neighborhood along the way.\n#Person1#: that would be wonderful. Thanks!
#Person1#: What are you reading?\n#Person2#: Oh, it's the latest novel by ray blue. It's a sic-fi thriller.\n#Person1#: I thought he usually wrote horror books.\n#Person2#: He does. He's good at this genre too. It's a captivating read.\n#Person1#: We're going to the bookshop. Would you like to join us?\n#Person2#: Yes, I would. I need to buy a textbook for my course and, as you know, I love browsing through the latest paperbacks.\n#Person1#: Me too. I need something to read on the flight to new york. I can never sleep on planes. Sarah wants to pick up some children's books for her daughter.\n#Person2#: I want to look at nelson Mandela's autobiography.\n#Person1#: This is sure to be a worthwhile read.
#Person1#: Doctor, I feel much better now. Will I be albe to go home some time this week?\n#Person2#: That's good to hear. You've had an ideal recovery from your operation. We're going to send you home tomorrow.\n#Person1#: Do you think I can get back to work very soon?\n#Person2#: Don't be in such a hurry. I'm confident that you'll be completely recovered in 4 to 6 weeks.\n#Person1#: Is there anything I should do?\n#Person2#: You'd better have a good rest for a week. Be sure to have regular meals. Stay away from alcohol. Give up smoking at least a little while.\n#Person1#: Should I take some medicine?\n#Person2#: Yes. I'm going to give you some. Take one tablet of this medicine three times a day before meals. For that one, two tablets. And remember to come to the outpatient department for a consultation in two weeks, please.\n#Person1#: It's very kind of you.\n#Person2#: You're welcome. We wish you a speedy recovery. Goodbye.
#Person1#: Thomas, could you do me a favor?\n#Person2#: What's up?\n#Person1#: Could you pick up Mrs. David from Ford Company at the Capital Airport?\n#Person2#: Why don't you go?\n#Person1#: I'm supposed to do it, but the general manager called me last night. He said he couldn't come back to Beijing as scheduled, so he asked me to attend the meeting for him.\n#Person2#: I see. I'll do it for you.\n#Person1#: Thanks a lot. It's very kind of you.
#Person1#: I feel like to wear my hair in this way.\n#Person2#: Oh, it's really popular these days.\n#Person1#: Do you think it's suitable for me?\n#Person2#: Honestly speaking, I think the one next to it suits you better.\n#Person1#: Even though I really like it, it's just too modern for me.\n#Person2#: That's not true. Look over there! That lady chose the same one and she is surely older than you.\n#Person1#: Okay then. And I also want to have my hair colored.\n#Person2#: Which color do you like?\n#Person1#: Claret-red.\n#Person2#: Nice choice.\n#Person1#: How long will it take? I hope it won't be too long.\n#Person2#: I hope not but it will take at least three hours.\n#Person1#: Now it's my son's turn to wait.
#Person1#: What did you say?\n#Person2#: I said it's a lovely day. Why don't we go for a walk?\n#Person1#: Well, I feel a little tired.\n#Person2#: Come on! Rest breads rust.\n#Person1#: Then can you wait a few minutes? I want to finish writing this letter.\n#Person2#: I hope it won't be too long. It would be a shame not to take advantage of such lovely weather.\n#Person1#: It won't be long. No more than ten minutes. Why don't you go ahead and I'll meet you in the park?\n#Person2#: OK! See you later!
#Person1#: IBA Bank, Business Banking Department. Ling Ming speaking. How may I help you?\n#Person2#: Ms. Ling! It's Mr. Gwent, from Montgomery Computers.\n#Person1#: Hello, Mr. Gwent. What can I do for you today?\n#Person2#: Some money has been sent from our Head Office in Berlin. Could you check whether you have received the remittance yet?\n#Person1#: Of course. Do you know which bank it was sent through and the amount and currency?\n#Person2#: Deutsche Bank. It was 25, 000 US dollars.\n#Person1#: Yes, here it is. That's received and cleared, so it's available for withdrawal.
#Person1#: May I help you?\n#Person2#: Yes, I would like to return these slacks.\n#Person1#: Alright. Do you have your receipt?\n#Person2#: Yes. Here it is. I bought them last week.\n#Person1#: And why are you returning them?\n#Person2#: I bought them to go with a blouse of mine. But they don't really match.\n#Person1#: I see. Oh, wait. Ma'am, I'm sorry. These slacks were on sale.\n#Person2#: Yes, they were thirty percent off.\n#Person1#: I'm sorry, but we don't allow returns on sale items.\n#Person2#: I know many stores have that policy. But I have returned sale items here before.\n#Person1#: I'm sorry, but we usually don't do it. It is our policy.\n#Person2#: I just bought these slacks a week ago. And I am a regular customer here. Can you make an exception this time?\n#Person1#: Well. Let me talk to the manager for a moment. Ma'am, the manager says I can do it this time.\n#Person2#: Good. I'm a regular customer here. I am glad you can make an exception for me.\n#Person1#: Please show me your receipt again.\n#Person2#: Here it is.\n#Person1#: I will have to give you store credit, Ma'am. If you find something else you like in the store, you can use the credit.\n#Person2#: Store credit is okay with me. I'm sure I will find something I like. I shop here a lot.\n#Person1#: We appreciate your business, Ma'am.
#Person1#: What forms should I fill out to collect unemployment?\n#Person2#: You need to fill out a special form to apply for unemployment benefits.\n#Person1#: Where do I get the application form for unemployment benefits?\n#Person2#: You can call the Employment Development Office and request a form.\n#Person1#: What information will I need to provide to apply for unemployment?\n#Person2#: Be prepared to provide your employer's name and address and what dates you worked.\n#Person1#: What else will the Employment Development Office need?\n#Person2#: You need to be prepared to show that your unemployment is not your fault. If you have a termination notice, that would be great.\n#Person1#: What will happen next?\n#Person2#: The Employment Development Office will call you for an interview.
#Person1#: Hello, how are you? I am Jack.\n#Person2#: Hello, I am Amy.\n#Person1#: What brings you here?\n#Person2#: I saw that your Corollas are on sale.\n#Person1#: Yes, it is really a good deal. $ 1, 000 discount. I've never seen a sale as good as this one.\n#Person2#: Tell me about Corollas.\n#Person1#: Sure. It has 1. 8 liter engine. This one comes with all power options, air condition, CD player, full size spare tire, automatic transmission and ABC. The window price is $ 17, 000, and I can give You for $ 16. 000.\n#Person2#: Sounds good. How about $ 15, 000?\n#Person1#: You must be kidding! You cannot get that price anywhere.\n#Person2#: I am serious. $ 15, 000.\n#Person1#: Can you put down a $ 2, 000 deposit, and I'll talk to my manager, see what we can do.\n#Person2#: No. Just talk to your manager and let me know.\n#Person1#: Okay, I'll be right back. . . Congratulations! The manager approved the final price $ 15, 000.\n#Person2#: The price is fine if you give me free security system and free carpet mats.\n#Person1#: You are really tough. You got a deal.\n#Person2#: Thanks!
#Person1#: So, tell me, what makes you think we should give you a raise?\n#Person2#: I've got several good reasons. I've been here several years, my work has proven to be good, and I've noticed that people in comparable jobs get paid more than I do.\n#Person1#: Salaries are confidential, how do you know how much money these ' other people ' make?\n#Person2#: Well, I've noticed all the new cars around here, for one thing.\n#Person1#: Those are company cars provided to the sales staff for their business trips. Also, some employees receive sales commissions. So good salesmen will naturally earn more.\n#Person2#: That's understandable. Well, rather than comparing my salary with someone else's, perhaps we could talk about my job performance. Surely you've noticed the extra hours I've put in recently?\n#Person1#: I see your point. However, it might be hard to get a raise approved. Profits were down last quarter, and the whole company is tightening its belt, so anything that affects the annual budget\n#Person2#: That would be very good of you, Mr. White.
#Person1#: Ann! Don't you see the children are making so much noise here? Why don't you keep them occupied and out their mother's hair?\n#Person2#: OK! What about taking them outside and flying a kite.\n#Person1#: Good idea! Well, Joan, I have something important to tell you.
#Person1#: Why have you stopped production?\n#Person2#: We've had a few problems. One of the bolts has worked loose and a blade has snapped off.\n#Person1#: OK. Make sure the power is switched off then tighten up all the bolts on the unit and replace the broken blade. Why is there oil all over the floor?\n#Person2#: I think the valve is faulty. I couldn't regulate the pressure and the seal burst. I tried opening the emergency valve but it was jammed.\n#Person1#: Clean up the mess first, then fit a new seal and check the valve.
#Person1#: Can I help you?\n#Person2#: Yes. I want to make a plane reservation to Shanghai, China.\n#Person1#: May I have your name, please?\n#Person2#: Feynman Black. I want to leave on October 15th.\n#Person1#: OK. Let me see. Air China has a flight on October 15th at 10:00 in the morning.\n#Person2#: Well, I need an economy ticket.\n#Person1#: Single or return?\n#Person2#: Single. How much?\n#Person1#: Economy fare for single ticket from New York to Beijing is 400 dollars.\n#Person2#: OK. Here you are. Is my ticket confirmed then?\n#Person1#: Yes. Please arrive at the airport one hour before departure.\n#Person2#: OK. Thank you.
#Person1#: Hi, Dave. This is Zina.\n#Person2#: Zina? Zina the Snake?\n#Person1#: I got your e-mail a couple of months back.\n#Person2#: Yeah? Which one was that?\n#Person1#: The one that said, You're a creep. From me you won't hear another peep. I hope you wreck your jeep.\n#Person2#: Right. That one. Did it work?
#Person1#: Home at last. Tonight we have a lot of homework though.\n#Person2#: Are you saying we don't have time to watch our favorite show tonight? Jane, you know I really don't like our teacher all that much. He gives far too much homework. He criticizes me in front of everyone all the time.\n#Person1#: To tell the truth, I don't really like him either. He's kind of boring and not very active. He always looks unhappy too.\n#Person2#: Yes, and he also. . .\n#Person1#: Do you think we should be talking about him like this behind his back?\n#Person2#: Probably not. After all he is our teacher. We should try to find something nice to say. If you can't say something nice you shouldn't say anything at all.\n#Person1#: I absolutely agree. It's getting dark. We should finish our homework now.\n#Person2#: All right. I want to take a shower first, I'm exhausted.
#Person1#: There will be another sandstorm here tomorrow.\n#Person2#: It's the fourth one this year. Isn't it horrible.\n#Person1#: Yes. We should plant more trees and grass to stop the sand from spreading.\n#Person2#: It may take many years for the trees to grow. I hope people will stop cutting down trees.\n#Person1#: But we need the wood.\n#Person2#: But we can't destroy our forests to get the wood.
#Person1#: I had prepared dinner for eight people before Mary called and said that she and her husband could not make it.\n#Person2#: That's all right. I am just going to tell you I have invited Tom and his girlfriend.
#Person1#: Hey Claire, you've been really quiet these last few days. Is something wrong? \n#Person2#: I've been really stressed. It's the end of the year and I've got so much stuff to do! I feel like I'm drowning in work. \n#Person1#: Well, stress is a real thing. It's not an imaginary condition. \n#Person2#: It's seriously affecting my life! I can't sleep, I don't have much of an appetite and my husband says I've been kind of short tempered. Other people seem to handle stress okay. . . why am I so weak? \n#Person1#: You're not weak. . . you're stressed out! Stress has been a part of the human condition for millions of years. Back when we still lived in the trees we had to watch out for predators. . . and as you might imagine, that was pretty stressful. \n#Person2#: Yeah, but I don't see any tigers or leopards roaming around our office. My stress is just about silly paperwork! \n#Person1#: But you're actually having the same reaction as our tree-dwelling ancestors! It's called the flight or fight response. Each time you feel like something's threatening you, your body decides whether to run away or fight. . . it causes all sorts of chemical reactions in the body. \n#Person2#: So a deadline will cause that same reaction? \n#Person1#: It could. Modern humans actually have more flight or fight responses than our ancestors did. They just had a couple of close calls every day, but today, we have dozens or even hundreds! \n#Person2#: So the life of a cave woman was less stressful than my life? 
#Person1#: Hoo, I'm getting tired, Jeanine, been a long day. \n#Person2#: I'm not quitting yet. You know my favourite slogan, don't you? \n#Person1#: Yeah, I know. Shop till you drop. \n#Person2#: Right! \n#Person1#: I'm getting a little short on cash. Let's just window shop a little. \n#Person2#: Ok. \n#Person1#: Hey, Jeanine, get a load of that. It's beautiful. \n#Person2#: Hahaha, and I thought you were tired. \n#Person1#: You know . . I have a weakness for long dresses. \n#Person2#: It sure looks special, looks expensive too. \n#Person1#: Sure does. Hey, can I sponge a little cash of you? \n#Person2#: Don't worry, Marian, I've got you covered. \n#Person1#: Thanks, Jeanine, you are a real pal. Let's go in. 
#Person1#: do you like animals? I really like dogs. \n#Person2#: so do i. I don't like cats. \n#Person1#: why? I think cats are ok. \n#Person2#: I can't bear being near cats. They don't seem to like me either. \n#Person1#: I like wild animals. I don't like spiders and snakes. I think spiders and snakes are disgusting. \n#Person2#: I'm fond of snakes. I think they're great. I agree with you about spiders though. I think spiders are horrible. I think it's because they have so many legs. \n#Person1#: I think bears are wonderful. Pandas are fantastic. I low the people who kill them for their fur. \n#Person2#: I agree. I'm carzy about mice. I think they're so cute! \n#Person1#: really? I don't see the attraction. I'm afraid of mice. 
#Person1#: Tom has grown six inches within a year. \n#Person2#: He has reached puberty. His mind and body both will change a lot. \n#Person1#: Yeah, do you see his Adam's apple? It becomes bigger. \n#Person2#: Time is flying. I still remember everything when he was a child. 
#Person1#: What's the weather like in your city? \n#Person2#: In the summer it gets very hot. The temperture is between often 37 and 40 centigrade. When it is hot we often get rains. The winters are drier. \n#Person1#: The summer tempreture ususally often reaches about 20 or25 in my city. The rain falls mostly in the winter. And we often get snow. \n#Person2#: What are the temperatures in winter? In my city it is about 15 or 20 degrees. \n#Person1#: In winter temperture often falls to zero at night temperture can be below that. The streets are often icing in the morning. With high such tempertures you must get some thunderstorns. \n#Person2#: Yeah, we do. In the middle of summer there can be found storms every day ususally in the afternoon. I heard your city has a lot of fog, is that true? \n#Person1#: We do have a few fog days in winter. But I would not say we have a lot of fogs. The sky are usually clearly in your city, are they? \n#Person2#: Yes, they are like I said we have thunderstorms. But each one usually last a few hours. Then the skys are clear again. \n#Person1#: Have you ever had snow in your city? \n#Person2#: My grandmother said there was snow once when she was a child. But my parents and I never see it outside of my city. \n#Person1#: The river in my city sometime freeze over. People go ice-skating on it. In summer people go boating on the river. But few people go swimming because it is not very clean. \n#Person2#: As you know, my city is on the coast. the water is also not clean. But people still go swimming all year around. I perfer to sand bath on the beach when the weather is hot and sunning. 
#Person1#: Good morning , can I help you? \n#Person2#: I want to American breakfast with fried eggs sunny side up. \n#Person1#: What kind of juice do you prefer , sir? \n#Person2#: Breakfast juice and please make my coffee very strong. \n#Person1#: Yes , sir. American breakfast with fried eggs sunny side up. Breakfast juice and black coffee. And my correct, sir? \n#Person2#: Yes, that's right. \n#Person1#: Is there anything else , sir? \n#Person2#: No , that's all. \n#Person1#: Good morning , sir .

I'll get them for you right away. Would you please sign this bill first? Thank you , sir. 
#Person1#: I can bet the farm that you will regret about your decision. You cannot find a better one. \n#Person2#: How can you be so sure? You haven't been together with her, have you? \n#Person1#: No. But I'm sure she is a good girl. My sixth sense tells me so. \n#Person2#: Then try it yourself. 
#Person1#: Excuse me, madam, I wonder if you could help me.\n#Person2#: Yes.\n#Person1#: Do you happen to know anything about the Flower Show?\n#Person2#: Well, it is in the Forest Park.\n#Person1#: Can you tell me something about it? Is it interesting?\n#Person2#: I'm afraid I'm not really sure because I have not had the time to see it, but my daughter was there that day before yesterday. She said it was really beautiful. All sorts of flowers, roses, tulips. You name it, they have it. You see the show is one of the tourist attractions in our city. Go there and take a look, young man.\n#Person1#: I will. By the way, do you know when it is open?\n#Person2#: Well, let me see. It's open in the afternoon. My daughter told me.\n#Person1#: Thanks.
#Person1#: Lost and found. How can I help you?\n#Person2#: I'm ringing because I lost my bag yesterday.\n#Person1#: I see. Well, we received 8 bags yesterday. What color is it?\n#Person2#: It's black.\n#Person1#: Em, I've got 3 bags here. Can you give me some more information?\n#Person2#: It's quite large. I wear it over my shoulder. It's got a zip on the front and there's a pocket on the side for a mobile phone.\n#Person1#: Is there anything in it?\n#Person2#: Yes. There's an address book and some keys. Oh, and hissy the snake.\n#Person1#: There's a snake in your bag?\n#Person2#: Don't worry, it's made of plastic.It belongs to my little son.\n#Person1#: Right. Well, I think we have your bag here.
#Person1#: We are finally in our last year of highschool. How exciting! I can't wait to graduate.\n#Person2#: Neither can I. But I don't think this year is going to be that easy.\n#Person1#: What do you mean?\n#Person2#: Well, in order to get into a good college, we have to take challenging classes this year.\n#Person1#: Of course, but we'll still have some time for fun.\n#Person2#: I don't know. I'm taking advanced math, English, 2 different science classes.\n#Person1#: Oh, don't worry. You've taken difficult classes before.\n#Person2#: Yes, but I'm also volunteering at the hospital 3 times a week. I think it will help me get into medical school.\n#Person1#: I'm volunteering, too. I expect to be busy this year, but I still plan to enjoy myself.\n#Person2#: Where are you volunteering?\n#Person1#: At the zoo. You should come visit. I'll be there every Saturday and Sunday.
#Person1#: Why are you looking so upset? What's the problem?\n#Person2#: I have to write a long article and I just can't come up with any ideas. And I have to hand it in tomorrow.\n#Person1#: That shouldn't be too difficult. Remember those pictures you showed me last week?\n#Person2#: Sure. I've got them here.\n#Person1#: Why don't you write about your impressions of the pyramids in Egypt?\n#Person2#: Sounds like a good idea. I can also tell about our visit to North Africa and all of the historical places we visited.\n#Person1#: Well, now that you are feeling better about this, I think I'll be on my way. I have to finish my article, too.\n#Person2#: Thanks. Once organized, it won't be so difficult.
#Person1#: I want to book a bus tour for the middle of June.\n#Person2#: Well, we have red and blue routes. The main attractions on the red route are the White House, the Lincoln Memorial and the Smithsonian Museum.\n#Person1#: How do I book the tickets?\n#Person2#: Well, you could do that by phone with one of our operators, or you can book through our website. Of course, you could just show up and buy a ticket the day you want to take the tour.\n#Person1#: Alright. I'll just book it online once I know our travel dates.\n#Person2#: OK, well, just remember that it can get very busy over the three months from June to August. So it's probably best to book at least a week before you come, but you still have about 6 weeks. So you have plenty of time to think about it.\n#Person1#: OK, thanks. You've been a great help.
#Person1#: You look rather pale. Are you feeling well?\n#Person2#: Not very. I was sick most of the night. I didn't sleep very well.\n#Person1#: What seems to be the matter? Is it the flu?\n#Person2#: No, I think it was something I ate. We ate at that new restaurant last night and I must have eaten something that didn't agree with me.\n#Person1#: Was it that new restaurant over on fourth street?\n#Person2#: As a matter of fact it was. Why do you ask?\n#Person1#: Jerry ate there last week and had the same kind of problem. He was sick the next day, too.\n#Person2#: Maybe the health authorities should investigate the place.\n#Person1#: That's what I think. 2 people having similar problems in such a short time can't be a coincidence.
#Person1#: Hello, it is Carol, isn't it?\n#Person2#: Oh! Mike? Oh my goodness, I haven't seen you for ages.\n#Person1#: Nice to see you again after all these years. What have you been doing?\n#Person2#: Well, I tried many things after we left school. I'm now working for a large oil company, in charge of sales mainly, so I travel a lot.\n#Person1#: Oh, that's great, you must really enjoy that.\n#Person2#: Oh, I do. It's exciting, it is quite tiring, though. What about you Mike? What do you do?\n#Person1#: I work in a law firm. I'm practicing business law, you know?\n#Person2#: Oh, that's interesting.\n#Person1#: Yeah, I'm happy doing what I do.\n#Person2#: Good.\n#Person1#: Anyway, it's great to see you, we must get together sometime.\n#Person2#: Yes, we should, look, give me your address and phone number and then I'll call you and we can fix something up.\n#Person1#: Right, well, it's my address and phone number.
#Person1#: A new school year is coming, but I learned that some children will not go to school. Are they dropping out?\n#Person2#: No, they just learn at home with their parents as teachers.\n#Person1#: Ah? How do they get teaching materials?\n#Person2#: From educational companies, city libraries and the internet.\n#Person1#: Does it work?\n#Person2#: Why not? Home schooling could avoid problems of traditional schools. It also increases family time. Remember the 16-year-old boy homeschooled by his mother, he showed solutions to a nineteenth century math problem.\n#Person1#: Oh no, are you thinking of homeschooling ourselves? But some experts say children need to attend school to learn things like social skills.
#Person1#: Hi, what can I do for you?\n#Person2#: I'd like to send this package to France. Can it be delivered in the next 5 days?\n#Person1#: Yes, we offer an overnight service. It'll cost $70.\n#Person2#: Ah, that's a bit expensive. Do you have a 3 days service?\n#Person1#: No, but we can get your package to France in one week for $40.\n#Person2#: Well, that sounds good. I'll take that. Is the service guaranteed?\n#Person1#: Yes, we also offer a service where we can track your package, but that will cost $10 extra.\n#Person2#: Oh, I won't need the tracking service.
#Person1#: Are you here about your ticket?\n#Person2#: Yes, I am, Your Honor.\n#Person1#: What is your argument?\n#Person2#: Your Honor, the police officer pulled me over for speeding.\n#Person1#: You must've been speeding.\n#Person2#: No, Your Honor, I was not.\n#Person1#: Tell me how many miles per hour you were going.\n#Person2#: I was going 35 in a 40 mph zone.\n#Person1#: That's fine, so I'll let you go with a warning.\n#Person2#: So, I don't have to pay the ticket?\n#Person1#: You won't have to pay the fine.\n#Person2#: Thank you very much, Your Honor.
#Person1#: Hello, this is ABC Corporation. May I help you?\n#Person2#: Yes, I ' m enquiring about your advertisement for a sales manager in today ' s newspaper. Is this position still open?\n#Person1#: Yes, but do you have any experiences as a sales manager?\n#Person2#: Yes, I have a lot of previous experiences in sales.

#Person1#: Can you tell me, Ms. Smith, about the training programs you initiated this year?\n#Person2#: We ran a call center training service and language program to ensure that our customer service representatives are well trained.\n#Person1#: What ' s the result?\n#Person2#: We directly attribute an increase in our customer service feedback of 50 % to the increase in language skills and training that our employees have received.\n#Person1#: That seems very impressive. Good work!\n#Person2#: Thank you, but I cannot take all the credit. Our employees have all worked very hard to increase their productivity level.
#Person1#: Good afternoon, madam. How can I help you?\n#Person2#: Well, I am a bit out of shape.

What about the charge?\n#Person1#: That depends. We offer membership for one month, half a year and one year.\n#Person2#: Maybe one month. Just have a try first. Not too tough at the beginning.\n#Person1#: Wise decision. You'll find it's totally worth it.
#Person1#: I don't know if you remember, but with honest every day last year we tided the knot.\n#Person2#: Of course I remember, actually, I am very surprised you remembered, I thought for sure you would forget.\n#Person1#: How could I ever forget? I even bought you roses because I love you.\n#Person2#: They are so beautiful. I love them, and I love you too.\n#Person1#: You are more beautiful than the roses.\n#Person2#: I don't know how, but I love you more than the day we gotta married.\n#Person1#: Yes, we are match made in heaven.\n#Person2#: I know of the past years we have faced and shared troubles, but we survived and here we are.\n#Person1#: Yes, we did, we did have problems, but we shared a lot of happiness too. We countered the problems, and had a lot of happiness too.\n#Person2#: Yes we did.\n#Person1#: I love you, happy anniversary.\n#Person2#: I love you, happy anniversary.
#Person1#: Good coming! Welcome to J P Interior Design.\n#Person2#: Hi, I saw the sign outside says that you do all kinds of interior design.\n#Person1#: Yes, we do. Do you have any specific needs?\n#Person2#: Well, I am thinking about redesigning my kitchen.\n#Person1#: Do you prefer some specific style?\n#Person2#: Yes, I prefer a more contemporary design.\n#Person1#: What kind of color tones do you like?\n#Person2#: Blue, green or earth tone colors. I do not like the colors that are too bright.\n#Person1#: I see. And what kind of feeling do you want to create for your kitchen?\n#Person2#: I'd like it to look simple, neat and relaxing.\n#Person1#: Fine, we will take an actual look at your kitchen before start working on it.\n#Person2#: No problem. How about 10'o clock this Sunday morning?\n#Person1#: Okay. Would you please leave your address and phone number?\n#Person2#: Of course. This is my card. See you then.
#Person1#: How often are stockholders meetings held?\n#Person2#: Stockholders meetings are held biannually. Usually the meetings are scheduled for spring and fall. In between the meetings, each stockholder receives biannual reports. Financial statements are made once a year.\n#Person1#: What percentage of the stockholders actually attend the meetings? I'm guessing not a large percentage. . .\n#Person2#: You're right, it's a low percentage. Also, in order to attend meetings, you have to hold a certain amount of shares. It's quite a large number, so most of the stockers are excluded from proceedings.\n#Person1#: So, how much say do the stockholders really have?\n#Person2#: Unless they're united, very little. . .
#Person1#: Cheer!\n#Person2#: Cheer!\n#Person1#: So what time tomorrow?\n#Person2#: Half past seven in the morning.\n#Person1#: Where to meet?\n#Person2#: In the market.\n#Person1#: OK. Bottoms up.\n#Person2#: Bottoms up.\n#Person1#: It's on me.\n#Person2#: Thank you. This place is nice.
#Person1#: Has everything been OK with you lately?\n#Person2#: I haven't been able to get a good night's sleep lately. I'm exhausted!\n#Person1#: Have you been too busy to get enough sleep?\n#Person2#: I try to go to sleep, but I just can't stay asleep.\n#Person1#: How late do you try to go to sleep?\n#Person2#: I go to bed when I finish my work.\n#Person1#: Has anything in your day-to-day life been bothering you lately?\n#Person2#: I am worried about how I am going to pay my tuition.\n#Person1#: You might consider listening to relaxing music as you go to sleep to clear your head.\n#Person2#: Doing something relaxing before I go to sleep sounds like a plan.
#Person1#: My daughter plans to quit her present job and wants to find another. She says she wants to get a better job with higher pay.\n#Person2#: It seems quite normal to me. It is pretty much what I want to do.\n#Person1#: But what about settling down to start a family? Doesn't anyone want to get married any more?\n#Person2#: It is different now. The world is becoming colorful. Some of my friends don't feel the same pressure to marry. We all want to wait for the right moment.\n#Person1#: What time is the right moment?\n#Person2#: Let the universe find us instead of forcing love. We prefer natural love. The most important thing is to be happy. Love will find us later. That is what we say.
#Person1#: I have a problem.\n#Person2#: What's the problem?\n#Person1#: My mattress was supposed to be delivered today.\n#Person2#: Is there a problem?\n#Person1#: The delivery people showed up four hours late.\n#Person2#: I apologize for their tardiness.\n#Person1#: I was late for work because of them.\n#Person2#: Again, I do apologize for the inconvenience.\n#Person1#: I want my money back for the delivery.\n#Person2#: Seeing as they were late, that won't be a problem.\n#Person1#: It shouldn't be a problem.\n#Person2#: I'm going to refund your money right now.
#Person1#: The dinner was really good. It knocked my socks off.\n#Person2#: That's very kind of you to say so. Let's try some after-dinner wines.\n#Person1#: Great. Sweet wines are my favorite. They always make a great finish to a decisions meal.\n#Person2#: Do you prefer brandy or ports.\n#Person1#: Port, please.\n#Person2#: Excellent choice. I love its smooth flavor.\n#Person1#: The port is quite exquisite. It must have spent years aging in barrels. Am I right?\n#Person2#: Yes. You always have a good nose for wines.\n#Person1#: Next time we are about to dinner we should try some Canadian ice wine.\n#Person2#: Oh, what's that?\n#Person1#: It's made from naturally frozen grapes.\n#Person2#: Why not? It sounds great.\n#Person1#: OK, here's to your health.\n#Person2#: Thanks. Cheers.\n#Person1#: Cheers.
#Person1#: Mary and I decided to ring the curtain down on our love affair.\n#Person2#: What? You have been in love for six years, haven't you?\n#Person1#: Don't make a fuss. Many people divorce after having living together for many years.\n#Person2#: What a pity.
#Person1#: What are the seasons like in your city?\n#Person2#: Summers are hot and usually lasts a long time. Winters are short, but cold, wet, and windy. I love the summers in my city, but I hate the wintertime.\n#Person1#: Does it ever rain in summer?\n#Person2#: We usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks, but apart from that, summers are dry. Thunderstorms make the air fresh again, so most people don't mind then.\n#Person1#: What are spring and autumn like?\n#Person2#: I like spring because flowers bloom and trees grow leaves again. In spring, the weather is very changeable-sometimes cold, sometimes warm. It's usually windy with some rain. Autumn is usually sunny and dry, but it's gradually gets colder as winter arrives. What are the seasons like in you city?\n#Person1#: Well, I live in the southern hemisphere, so our summertime is your wintertime, and vice versa. We get some rain in every season, but most is in winter. In winter, it sometimes gets cold, but our winters are usually quite mild. Summers are warm, but not hot. Spring and autumn are both very short-sometimes just a few weeks each. The weather is very changeable then-just like spring in your city.\n#Person2#: Do you usually go on a summer holiday?\n#Person1#: No, I don't. I go on a winter holiday instead. I go somewhere warm.\n#Person2#: I usually go on holiday during the spring or the autumn. I try to go somewhere where the weather is more reliable than in my city.
#Person1#: May I help you?\n#Person2#: Yes, I'm going to Europe on business and I need to purchase some Traveller's Cheques.\n#Person1#: That's no problem. Which currency would you like to buy?\n#Person2#: I think Euros will be the best, as I'll only be in Mainland Europe.\n#Person1#: Of course. Do you have your passport with you? How much would you like to purchase?\n#Person2#: 5, 000 Euros will be sufficient, thanks.\n#Person1#: Please fill in this form. How would you like it? In 100 Euro cheques?\n#Person2#: That would be perfect, thank you.
#Person1#: I need to find a new place to live.\n#Person2#: Yeah? Why? Don't you like living with me?\n#Person1#: Oh, it's not you. I just want my own place.\n#Person2#: Well, check the newspaper.\n#Person1#: Jeez. . . I didn't realize a single bedroom apartment went for so much these days.\n#Person2#: Yeah, prices have really gone up the past couple of years.\n#Person1#: Oh, here's one. It's looks like its in this neighborhood, $ 600 a month. That's not to bad.\n#Person2#: No, it's pretty good. Why not give the landlord a call?\n#Person1#: Hello. I'm calling about the one bedroom in Lincoln Park. Could I take a look at it? Yes. Tonight at six is fine. Thanks.
#Person1#: Why don't you sit down and relax, darling?\n#Person2#: I don't want to.\n#Person1#: Well, come over and talk to me then.\n#Person2#: Certainly not.\n#Person1#: May I turn on the TV then?\n#Person2#: Turn on the TV, for what?\n#Person1#: So that we can sit down together and listen to some music.\n#Person2#: Listen to the music? And who will cook dinner, will you?\n#Person1#: I will, but let's go to the disco after dinner.\n#Person2#: To a disco? Oh, no. You know I hate it.
#Person1#: Hi. I need a wake-up call tomorrow.\n#Person2#: What time would you like your wake-up call?\n#Person1#: I need two calls, one at 7 and another at 7 fifteen.\n#Person2#: That is no problem at all, of course. You'll get a call at 7 o'colock and another at 7 fifteen.\n#Person1#: Then again, I think 7 fifteen is too early. Change 7 fifteen to 7 thirty, please.\n#Person2#: So, that'll be a call at 7 and another at 7 thirty. Do you have any other requests?\n#Person1#: Not just now, but if I do think of something later, I'll give you a ring.\n#Person2#: Okay, sir. Sleep well.
#Person1#: Mom, I'm ready for school.\n#Person2#: Let me feel your forehead. I'm so glad it wasn't strep throat.\n#Person1#: I don't have a fever, and I'm ready for my test.\n#Person2#: But I'm not sure you're strong enough yet. Here's some seafood rice soup I made. It's delicious.\n#Person1#: I'm fine, Mom. I feel so much better. I want to go to school. I'm missing out on all the fun.\n#Person2#: But the last two days were a weekend.\n#Person1#: Let me go to school, please! I'm sick of medicine, sick of soup, and sick of being sick!
#Person1#: OK. sir. Your room is done. Is there anything else I can do for you?\n#Person2#: Would you please help me send these clothes to the laundry?\n#Person1#: OK. sir.\n#Person2#: When will they be ready?\n#Person1#: All the laundry will be ready by 5\n#Person2#: That's fine. Thank you.
#Person1#: I have no idea what to buy for Mary for her birthday.\n#Person2#: Me neither! Would you like to go in and buy her a gift together?\n#Person1#: Yes, that would be good!\n#Person2#: We need to think about what she might like. What are her interests?\n#Person1#: If I remember right, she likes music, skiing, and reading.\n#Person2#: You know, maybe we could get her some concert tickets. Who would know her favorite groups?\n#Person1#: Her roommate, Malia, might know what her favorite groups are.\n#Person2#: Yeah, Malia would be able to help us choose a concert.\n#Person1#: Let's give Malia a call and ask her for her help right now.\n#Person2#: Good! Maybe Malia would like to go in with us on this gift.
#Person1#: I've been waiting here in the conference room for ten minutes already. What time does our meeting start? Where is everyone anyway?\n#Person2#: Didn't you hear about that? Our meeting was proponed until Friday.\n#Person1#: What? The meeting was proponed? No one told me anything about it.\n#Person2#: Didn't you get the memo?\n#Person1#: What memo? There haven't been any memos this whole week. I check my unbox every day, and I haven't seen anything.\n#Person2#: The memo went out three days ago. It should have made it to your in-box, but maybe it got lost in all the clutter on your desk.\n#Person1#: You know how things get piled up on my desk when I am busy, I know that sometimes I do misplace things, but I always read all the memos that go around. They go directly to my in-box. Are you sure it was sent to the whole office?\n#Person2#: It should have gone around to everybody. They also posted a copy of the memo in the break-room. Don't you ever look at the messages posted on the bulletin board?\n#Person1#: I'm usually too busy to take a bunch of coffee breaks and gossip by the water cooler. Anyway, I am sure the memo never got to my in-box. I'll have to talk to our secretary about it.\n#Person2#: That's right. You never know what you're missing out if you don't read the memos.
#Person1#: Your house is very old. Does it need redecorating?\n#Person2#: Yes, it really needs redecorating.\n#Person1#: Shall I help you with it?\n#Person2#: I don't suppose you could.\n#Person1#: I have much time. I suppose it can be done.\n#Person2#: I'll be glad if you would.
#Person1#: Which impresses you more, a book or a movie?\n#Person2#: The latter one would be my favorite. A great many movies have impressed me. But the first time what I watched was Titanic. In my memory, I first watched Titanic when I was a pupil in the second grade, though I didn't know too much about the love between men and women. I was terribly shocked by the horrible catastrophe when it is sinking. Some are screaming, some are too scared to say a word, some are murmuring prayers in the Bible and begging for the God's mercy. All in all, that was the first time I had viewed people's psychological status when confronted with the great disaster. And I learnt that men, including me, should always show respect to nature or properly reduce our confidence when saying men can conquer the world.
#Person1#: Lisa, I heard you worked as a guide at the Natural History Museum at the weekend.\n#Person2#: Yes. I told the visitors about butterflies and their living habits. It was fun. Did you have a good weekend?\n#Person1#: Yeah, but I'm kind of tired now. I stayed up late watching the soccer game.
#Person1#: Where are you going to plant the tree? By the front door?\n#Person2#: No, that would be silly. It'll grow too big. I'm going to put it at the back of the garage.\n#Person1#: I thought it would be better right at the other end of the garden.\n#Person2#: Oh, no.
#Person1#: Hey, Brandon.\n#Person2#: Yeah.\n#Person1#: Um ... Um ...\n#Person2#: What?\n#Person1#: Well, I need to talk to you, and I'm not really sure how to do it. It's kind of difficult, but I kind of, I need to talk to you about something.\n#Person2#: Alright. Go ahead.\n#Person1#: Okay. You know, Stephanie. [Yeah.] You're dating my sister, right? Stephanie. [Yeah, yeah.] Um, I think she's back on drugs.\n#Person2#: What do you mean? I, I know she had a problem in the past, but she told me that that was over.\n#Person1#: Well, that's what she says, but you know, I know my sister pretty well; I think I know her better than just about anyone else, and I know you guys have talked about getting married soon, and [Yeah] ... I'm pretty sure she's using drugs again, and you really need to, you need to know this ... you really need to face the facts, and you're going to have to deal with this now.\n#Person2#: So, but, I ... again, how do you know?\n#Person1#: She's doing some of the same stuff, you know, um, like. Well, like. Listen, you know. Um, you've noticed she's been skipping work lately?\n#Person2#: Well, she said she's been having some health problems, so I just figured it was that.\n#Person1#: No, no, no. She's not. [ Are you sure? ] Yeah. It's, it's more than that. Like, a month ago, she asked me to lend her a thousand bucks to fix her car.\n#Person2#: Wow. Man. Um, I mean, she didn't tell me anything like that. I mean, her car is running fine, I think.\n#Person1#: Yeah, I know, it is. It's running fine. [ Oh, great. ] Exactly. She's lying a lot now, and she's, you know, she's trying to hide it, and she's good at hiding it.\n#Person2#: And, I let her borrow my car a couple days ago, and I had fifty bucks in there, and when the car came back, it was gone. She's ... I don't know how else it could have disappeared. [ Man. I can't belive this. ] I'm pretty sure she stole it.\n#Person1#: I know. Um, but she's hiding things, and she hides things from us, and okay, for example, like last week. I saw her with the two cell phones, and when I checked the texts on the one phone ....\n#Person2#: Wait, wait. Two phones? What do you mean?\n#Person1#: ....Yeah, umm.\n#Person2#: She only has one.\n#Person1#: No, she's got at least two phones, and when I checked the one phone, I saw some texts, and she was talking about, um, um, some drugs and needing to meet up with someone to buy them.\n#Person2#: Ah, man.\n#Person1#: I'm sorry, Brandon, um, I ... we need to, we need to confront her on this. You need to confront her on this.\n#Person2#: I don't know how to do this. I mean ... yeah, I don't know.\n#Person1#: I know, but you've got to. You, you can't ... the ... you know, you've got to do this if you want to try to hope that there's going to be anything to this relationship. It's, it's much better to talk to her openly about this now, cause, I promise you, the problems will just escalate, so ...\n#Person2#: But, she might blow up.\n#Person1#: She might, but hey, wait, listen. Why don't you guys come over for dinner and we can talk about it together? You know, um ...\n#Person2#: I just don't know.\n#Person1#: I know, and you're right, she might blow up, but if you don't do anything, I promise the problems are just going to get bigger. She's probably going to end up losing her job, she's probably going to get arrested, and she might even die.\n#Person2#: Man, you're probably right. I have to think about this and how to approach her. Alright. Let, let me thing about it, and I'll call you. [ Okay. ] Alright, thanks.\n#Person1#: Alright. Bye, Brandon.
#Person1#: You often come to school late as well. Yesterday, for example, you...\n#Person2#: Yes. I'm very sorry about that. You see, my alarm clock didn't work and...\n#Person1#: Your alarm clock? But you told me yesterday that the bus had broken down!\n#Person2#: Oh, did I? I just forgot to say that my clock didn't work, either.\n#Person1#: It's a good story. Now, tell me again why you want tomorrow off.\n#Person2#: Well...er, you see, my grandmother is ill. She is in hospital and... and she is going to have an operation. I want to visit her.\n#Person1#: Oh, I see. So your grandfather is ill as well.\n#Person2#: As well? I... I don't understand.\n#Person1#: Neither do I. When we began this conversation, you said your grandmother was ill. And you didn't say she was going to have an operation! You said she had already had one! And by the way, you also said she was in an old people's home, not in a hospital.
#Person1#: I used to go to the cinema a lot. It did make a nice night out, but not now.\n#Person2#: No, I don't either. There aren't any good adventurous stories like the movies they made when I was young.
#Person1#: May I take this book out? I need it work on my paper for Dr. Smith's history class.\n#Person2#: I'm afraid not. The book has been put on reserve by Dr. Smith. Unless you have his written permission, we won't lend it out.
#Person1#: I don't enjoy dating anymore. I can't seem to find anyone I have anything in common with.\n#Person2#: Don't feel discouraged. Be patient. As you are so distinguished, you will definitely find the person who is right for you.\n#Person1#: To tell you the truth, I am tired of being alone. I hope to find my Mrs. Right. What should I do?\n#Person2#: Do you believe in Internet matchmaking service?\n#Person1#: That's really a new walk of life. What is it exactly?\n#Person2#: It helps match up singles the world over, and helps find the man and woman of their dreams.\n#Person1#: Oh, it must be to the taste of a certain group of people.\n#Person2#: The advertisement said Dream Dates has matched up thousands of singles the world over!\n#Person1#: Unbelievable! They must be exaggerating the figure!\n#Person2#: Look at the way they manage their business: they collect applicants' photos, and give the applicants questionnaires to fill out as to what type of character they are.\n#Person1#: I don't believe several questions can decide the type of person you're. People's characters are complicated and keep changing all the time.\n#Person2#: Anyway, it seems that things work well this way. The information and specifications will be entered in a large computer database.\n#Person1#: A computer to decide your best date? That's really ridiculous!\n#Person2#: Look, it promises: Dream Dates provides expert dating service and a place for singles to meet. We'll introduce you to the person uniquely qualified to be your partner.\n#Person1#: Sheer slogans! Not reliable!\n#Person2#: It says you can enroll in a free trial membership!\n#Person1#: I won't do it even they pay me for that!\n#Person2#: Well, we don't have to believe this. Maybe I can tell John, and see whether he'd like to try it.
#Person1#: So, how long have you been living here?\n#Person2#: About six months now.\n#Person1#: Why did you choose Beirut?\n#Person2#: Because, Mike-my husband-and I have always loved Arab culture and the language. Mike's an English teacher and he got a job here in a language school.\n#Person1#: Why did you want to take a year off?\n#Person2#: Basically I wanted a break from teaching. I love teaching children but I needed a change. Also I've been drawing and painting since I was little but I've never really had the chance to study drawing. So this seemed like the perfect opportunity to have a change and learn to draw properly.\n#Person1#: Well, I found a fantastic art teacher, called Omayma, and I've been having classes with her since October. She's great and she speaks English, which is lucky, because I don't know much Arabic yet. But I'm learning the language as quickly as I can.\n#Person2#: Is Arabic a difficult language to learn?\n#Person1#: Incredibly difficult! Especially the pronunciation. You have to learn to make a lot of new sounds.
#Person1#: Congratulations on breaking the records at the recent Olympics, Miss Green!\n#Person2#: Thank you, Mr. Rarker.\n#Person1#: Oh, look at those trophies! You became a swimming star at the age of fifteen, didn't you?\n#Person2#: Yeah, you're right.\n#Person1#: Could you tell me something about your plans for the future?\n#Person2#: To tell you the truth, I'm going to give up swimming from now on.\n#Person1#: I beg your pardon?\n#Person2#: I mean I'd rather not swim at all. I'm too old to...\n#Person1#: Excuse me, if I'm not wrong, you've only twenty now. Is it too old at twenty?\n#Person2#: Yes, too old for a swimmer. If I swim in an international competition, I'll hardly be able to win.\n#Person1#: But...er...don't you enjoy swimming?\n#Person2#: Certainly, and I enjoy visiting other countries, and the Olympics are very exciting. However, I missed more important things. I had to work very hard at swimming. There was training before school, after school, and at weekends. While other girls were growing up, I was swimming, swimming. But life isn't merely swimming, is it?
#Person1#: How are the children doing at sport? \n#Person2#: I'm very pleased with their performances. Timmy can cover the 100 meters in 12 seconds. That's very fast for a kid his age. \n#Person1#: He's not very good at the long jump though, is he? \n#Person2#: He's not bad. He can jump a distance of over four meters. I think he just prefers running to jumping. Jimmy's very good at the high jump. He can jump over two meters. Again, that's fine for someone hi \n#Person1#: Two meters? That means that the high jump bar is above his head! Are any of them good at long-distance running? \n#Person2#: The longest race we run is the 1500 meters. A few of the boys and one girls can do it in less than five minutes. \n#Person1#: How are they at swimming? \n#Person2#: They're ok. I ask them to swim 500 meters each day. That's 20 lengths of the swimming pool. They're not very fast, but that's ok. I just want them to build their strength up and keep in shape. \n#Person1#: Kate is very good at diving from a height of 10 meters. \n#Person2#: I'd be afraid to jump from that height! \n#Person1#: I think that these kinds haven't learnt to be afraid yet. She started diving from a lower height, but she soon wanted to go higher. \n#Person2#: It seems that they really enjoy to go faster, higher and further. 
#Person1#: I'm so hungry. Shall we go eat now, Rick? \n#Person2#: sure. Where do you want to go? Are you in the mood for anything in particular? \n#Person1#: how about some dumplings? I just can't get enough of them. \n#Person2#: dumplings again? ! Oh, Amy, let's try something new! \n#Person1#: well, what do you have in mind? \n#Person2#: how about the Mongolian hot pot? \n#Person1#: oh, it's too spicy for me. Don't you remember last time when I tasted the lamb? It was so spicy my eyes teared up! \n#Person2#: maybe we can try Yuanyang pot this time. You can choose the non-spicy soup base. \n#Person1#: sounds great. Do they serve noodles? I am in the mood for some tasty noodles as well. \n#Person2#: yes. The sliced noodles they offer are among the most authentic Shanxi cuisines. \n#Person1#: great. Let's go! \n#Person2#: wait a minute. Let me throw on a sweater. 
#Person1#: Hi, Nally, are you hungry? \n#Person2#: I'm starving. Let's go grab a bite. \n#Person1#: Where to? \n#Person2#: How about Karlis? \n#Person1#: Are you kidding? That place is too ritzy for lunch. \n#Person2#: True . ok Let's go to Gerumose? \n#Person1#: Same thing, meals there all coarsen arm and leg. \n#Person2#: I guess it is a little pricy. \n#Person1#: Let's stop it at Multicolor for a quick lunch. . \n#Person2#: That will be Ok. Come on , I can't wait to chow down. \n#Person1#: That was a great lunch , the food was good ,but the service was lousy. \n#Person2#: Is that why you stiffed the waiter? \n#Person1#: You got it . All right, Let's go back to school. 
#Person1#: No, Vince, not next week. Now. You need to guarantee me 5 percent. \n#Person2#: But you just said 4 percent! \n#Person1#: If the next word out of your mouth isn't Yes it's going up to 6 percent. \n#Person2#: Yes! OK, yes. Stop it! You are just ruthless. \n#Person1#: That's why you love me. One other thing. Did you leave me a note this morning on a green post-it? \n#Person3#: I don't think so. Mine are yellow. Why? \n#Person2#: Never mind. I'm looking for somebody who uses green. 
#Person1#: May I help you, sir? \n#Person2#: Yes, please. I'm looking for a cotton polo shirt. \n#Person1#: Any particular colour? \n#Person2#: Not really. \n#Person1#: How about this one? \n#Person2#: I like the design, but don't particularly care for the colour. Do you have that in other colours, too? \n#Person1#: Well, they come in white, pale yellow, aqua, red and green. Will a white one do? \n#Person2#: Yes. I prefer white - and may I see a pale yellow one, too? \n#Person1#: Why, of course. Let's see. . . White. . . Pale yellow. Here you are, sir. 
#Person1#: What do you think about this store? I heard it's a posh store that's only got branches in big cities. \n#Person2#: I love this store. The only problem is that it's extremely expensive. \n#Person1#: Don't worry. I've decided that for your birthday I'm going to take you shopping for a new dress. \n#Person2#: Really? I thought you hated shopping? \n#Person1#: I do, that's why you should appreciate this gift! \n#Person2#: Sure. That's really nice of you. Let's go in and try some things on. \n#Person1#: How about this red dress? I think it would really suit you. \n#Person2#: That's gorgeous! Do they have it in a size 8? \n#Person1#: Here you go. On any other day, it would cost me a fortune, but it's on special offer today. \n#Person2#: I think this color isn't quite right for me. Do they have the same dress in white? \n#Person1#: Let me look. Let's see ... they've got one in blue, green, pink, black... and white. Here you are. \n#Person2#: This is perfect! What do you think? \n#Person1#: I think you look fantastic. Happy Birthday! \n#Person2#: I'm so lucky. You only get a chance like this once in a blue moon! Thanks honey! 
#Person1#: I hear you're being sent to Madrid for the annual conference. Is that right? \n#Person2#: Yes, it would be my first trip overseas. Actually, it's going to be my first time leaving the country. \n#Person1#: Are you serious? You haven't even been anywhere on vacation? \n#Person2#: No, I have never vacationed anywhere exortic. But even if I don't get a chance to travel on my personal time, at least I can travel on company time! \n#Person1#: Well, being able to go to the conference sounds like such a great opportunity. Have you applied at the embassy for a visa yet? \n#Person2#: Yes, it wasn't too hard to get. All I had to do was fill out the paperwork and pay the application fee. \n#Person1#: You leave next Tuesday, right? What time is your flight? \n#Person2#: My flight departs at 7 am. I have everything except for my luggage ready. \n#Person1#: If your flight is leaving so early, I can take you to the airport and see you off. I'll still be able to make it into the office by 9. \n#Person2#: That would be great! Thanks a lot! 
#Person1#: I am thinking about resigning from my current job. \n#Person2#: Have you thought about it seriously? \n#Person1#: Yes, I have been thinking about it for quite a while. Now I finally make up my mind to leave. I have given my resignation letter to our boss last Friday. \n#Person2#: Ok, did you find a new company? \n#Person1#: Yes, I will move on to XYZ Company. \n#Person2#: Good for you, but your leaving will be a great loss to us. It is so nice to work with you. \n#Person1#: Thanks. I had learned so much from you and our colleagues. 
#Person1#: We've got a new manager in our department. \n#Person2#: Oh? You hoped to get that job, didn't you? \n#Person1#: Yes, I did. \n#Person2#: I'm sorry. That's too bad. Who is it? Who got the job, I mean? \n#Person1#: Someone called Drexler. Carl Drexler. He's been with the company onlytwo years. I've been here longer. And I know more about the job , too \n#Person2#: Hmm. Why do you think they gave it to him and not to you? \n#Person1#: Because I'm the wrong sex , of course ! \n#Person2#: You mean you didn't get the job because you're a woman? \n#Person1#: Yes, that was probably it! It isn't fair. \n#Person2#: What sort of clothes does he wear? \n#Person1#: A dark suit. White shirt. A tie. Why? \n#Person2#: Perhaps that had something to do with it. \n#Person1#: You mean you think I didn't get the job because I come to work in jeansand a sweater? \n#Person2#: It's possible, isn't it? \n#Person1#: Do you really think I should wear different clothes? \n#Person2#: Well. . . perhaps you should think about it. \n#Person1#: Why should I wear a skirt? Or a dress? \n#Person2#: I'm not saying you should. I'm saying you should think about it. That's all! \n#Person1#: Why should I do that? I'm good at my job! That's the only important thing ! \n#Person2#: Hmm. Perhaps it should be the only important thing. But it isn't. Not in this company. 
#Person1#: I can't believe you wear jeans to the office! Are you trying to lose your job? \n#Person2#: Of course not. I'm just observing casual day. On Fridays, the company doesn't require us to wear formal business attire. \n#Person1#: Wow! Nobody told me about that. Won't the relaxed dress code damage the company image? \n#Person2#: We don't think so. Casual days are becoming more common, and we believe employees can maintain a professional image without wearing uncomfortable clothes. \n#Person1#: I guess it lets people express their individual tastes. But won't some people abuse it ? \n#Person2#: Not really. Besides, there is a separate dress code for casual day. People can't just wear whatever they want. \n#Person1#: It seems that a relaxed atmosphere could hinder productivity. \n#Person2#: Believe it or not, it has the opposite effect. Employees are actually more productive on casual days. 
#Person1#: How did you choose courses when you were abroad? \n#Person2#: That's a very good question. Choosing proper courses and effectively planning a college schedule is very important to the progress toward your educational goal. In order to do these wisely and effectively, you should consult with a Program Adviser or Academic Counselor. \n#Person1#: Wait a minute. There are some new terms for me. I can hardly follow you. \n#Person2#: Ok, I will go into more detail. A Program Adviser or an Academic Counselor is usually an experienced professor who is responsible for all the necessary academic counseling through graduation. You can discuss with him the program selection, changing or adding a program, the requirements for graduation, and other problems related to your study. You will choose some courses, and then discuss with the adviser whether your choice can meet the requirements for graduation. \n#Person1#: Everything is so new to me. I think I'll have to experience a very difficult period when I get there. \n#Person2#: Sure, very difficult. \n#Person1#: I am very grateful for your advice. \n#Person2#: It's my pleasure to talk with you. 
#Person1#: But still, I didn't want this wallpaper. And every time I try to open a program, all I see is a cross-dressing Bush. \n#Person2#: I heard about that horrible virus! It automatically e-mails itself as an attachment to everyone in your address book. \n#Person1#: Well, it's already got on my computer. How do I get rid of it? \n#Person3#: Vote it out in the next election. \n#Person1#: Hey, knock it off-this is serious! \n#Person3#: Have the IT department run a virus disinfection program. Hopefully, the problem will be gone by 2005. 
#Person1#: Welcome.\n#Person2#: Hi, John. Hey, you've done a good job decorating this place. Really nice.\n#Person1#: Thanks. I'm glad you like it. Can I get you a drink?\n#Person2#: No, thanks. Let's go to prepare dinner. I am getting hungry.\n#Person1#: Here is the kitchen. I will chop the onions. Could you take the meat out of the fridge? It's in a yellow plastic container.\n#Person2#: Wow. This smells good.\n#Person1#: Could you slice those potatoes for me please?\n#Person2#: What are we having?\n#Person1#: My special dumplings. Sweet and sour pork with pineapple beef with onions and green peppers, eggplant and soy sauce and a few side dishes like tomatoes with sugar.\n#Person2#: Sounds wonderful.\n#Person1#: I'll start preparing the meat stuffing.\n#Person2#: I wish I had the recipe and could you tell me what's in this?\n#Person1#: I will tell you after dinner.
#Person1#: Excuse me, Mr. Brooke, I almost forgot there was a phone message here for you. Professor Johnson called and asked you to call him back.\n#Person2#: Where is he now? Do you know?\n#Person1#: He's staying in the Blackwood Hotel room 509.\n#Person2#: Thank you. Do you happen to have the number of the Blackwood Hotel?\n#Person1#: I'm sorry I don't, but you can get it from information just dial 114.\n#Person2#: Oh, and could I trouble you to change a dollar?\n#Person1#: Alright. Here is your change. By the way, the public phone is over there on your right.\n#Person2#: I see, thanks.
#Person1#: I can't sleep.\n#Person2#: What's wrong dear?\n#Person1#: I don't know. I just can't sleep.\n#Person2#: Is there anything bothering you?\n#Person1#: Maybe. I have a test on Friday and I'm worried I won't get a good grade.\n#Person2#: Well. You have a few days left the study. Is there anything I can do to help?\n#Person1#: Yeah. Can you help me understand some of the ideas I just can't get?\n#Person2#: Sure. we can start when you get home from school. For now though, close your eyes and think about nicer things. Then you'll be ready to learn tomorrow.\n#Person1#: Thanks, Daddy. You're always there for me when I need you.

What do you like to do in your spare time?\n#Person1#: I really like nature, flowers and trees.\n#Person2#: Central Park is a fantastic place for you to relax. There are also many plants. After that, we can go to the shopping mall around it.\n#Person1#: Good.
#Person1#: Would you like to come by and play bridge?\n#Person2#: Well, let's see. Why don't we go dancing for a change? We haven't done that for a long time.\n#Person1#: Well, to tell the truth, I don't really feel like it tonight. I had a pretty hard day and I'm sort of tired.\n#Person2#: Hmm. Well, in that case, we could go to the movies.\n#Person1#: Oh, we always go to the movies. Can't we do something different?\n#Person2#: Well, do you have any suggestions?\n#Person1#: Let's see. How do you feel about playing bridge?\n#Person2#: It's OK with me, but we don't have any beer and things.\n#Person1#: Well, shall I call Janet and ask her and Tom to come over, and I'll go to the store and buy some stuff.\n#Person2#: OK.\n#Person1#: Hello, Janet. It's me... Oh, fine. Just fine. Say, Janet, I was wondering if you and Tom were doing anything tonight... No? Well. would you like to come by our place and play a few hands of bridge?
#Person1#: my mp3 player is broken, so I want to change it for an mp4 player. Can you offer any advice about which brand and model to buy?\n#Person2#: an mp4 player? why don't you buy a new cell phone? You can find an mp4 player inside any of the latest cell phones.\n#Person1#: Oh, that's a good idea. Perhaps I should have a try.\n#Person2#: look at my cell phone. I can listen to music, watch movies, take pictures, play games, surf the web and download documents. It's just like a PAD.\n#Person1#: that's cool. I can use the computer and the internet pretty well, but I'm a little bit slow in the latest trends of digital products.\n#Person2#: that's Ok. you know, digital devices are becoming smaller and easier to carry, and they won't cost you too much.\n#Person1#: yeah, if I buy a cell phone like this, I don't have to take a music player everywhere I go, and I can save the cost of buying an extra mp4.\n#Person2#: that's right. what's the flash memory of your old mp3?\n#Person1#: 256MB.\n#Person2#: then any cell phone can meet your need because they generally have memories of over 512MB.
#Person1#: You're really fit, Paul.

How often do you exercise like that?\n#Person2#: About five times a week. What about you?\n#Person1#: Oh, I hardly ever exercise. I usually just watch TV in my free time. I guess I'm a real couch potato!

Is there really anything so fascinating with him?\n#Person2#: He appeals to the fans thanks to two things\n#Person1#: you mean he plays well? Yeah, he often scores by free kicks in crucial games.

Darn condoms aren't registered in our system.\n#Person2#: Oh, well that's okay, I'll get some later, thanks. . . Really it's no problem.\n#Person1#: Just hang on there a sec. Can I get a price check on ' Fun Times Ribbed Condoms ' please!
#Person1#: How was your shopping trip Martin?\n#Person2#: Actually it was the most interesting day I'Ve had so far.\n#Person1#: Oh really? Did you find any bargains?\n#Person2#: I did! I found this lovely teapot. It was the best one I saw in the shops.\n#Person1#: And how did you get around town?\n#Person2#: I took a taxi. It seemed the easiest thing to do.\n#Person1#: Right, so you didn't get lost?\n#Person2#: I did actually but I think I met some of the friendliest people in China. They soon showed me the way!
#Person1#: How long do you plan to stay here?\n#Person2#: To speak frankly, it doesn't depend on me.\n#Person1#: How so?\n#Person2#: I really want to obtain a permanent job. I won't leave as long as I have opportunity to apply my knowledge and get on well with my superiors and colleagues.\n#Person1#: What are your future plans and what kind of expectations do you have of the company?\n#Person2#: I know that generally it is possible to move from this position to a management position with two years experience in the company
#Person1#: Hello, hi, Stephanie.\n#Person2#: Hi, Tom. How are things going with you?\n#Person1#: Great. I've signed an agreement with ABC Company. How are things in the office. Is everything OK?\n#Person2#: Yes, when will you be back?\n#Person1#: I'm on the way now. I will be back soon.\n#Person2#: Umm. Can you pick up some paper for the printer? We have run out of paper.\n#Person1#: Hello, hello, what did you say?\n#Person2#: Can you hear me now? I mean I need some paper.\n#Person1#: What? Did you say to pick up some ink for the printer? Sorry, the signal isn't very good here. Can you repeat that, please?\n#Person2#: Well, I'll send you a text message to tell you exactly what I need.\n#Person1#: What?
#Person1#: Why is there never a bus when you want one?\n#Person2#: Good question. There aren't enough buses on this route.\n#Person1#: Sometimes I feel like writing a letter to the paper.\n#Person2#: Good idea. You should say that we need more subway lines, too.\n#Person1#: Yeah. There should be more public transportation in general.\n#Person2#: And fewer cars! There's too much traffic.\n#Person1#: Say, is that our bus coming?\n#Person2#: Yes, it is. But look. It's full!\n#Person1#: Oh, no! Let's go and get a cup of coffee. We can talk about this letter I'm going to write.
#Person1#: I see you are busy right now, Sue. As soon as you finish, I'd like to talk to you for a few minutes.\n#Person2#: That's OK. Come on in.\n#Person1#: Oh, no, I don't want to interrupt you. I can wait. I'll come back later.\n#Person2#: I'm afraid it's going to be a long wait! I'm working on my history paper.\n#Person1#: History paper? I thought you'd finished it. Didn't you turn it in on Friday?\n#Person2#: Uh - huh. But the professor just returned it to me. I was told to add ten more pages.\n#Person1#: Ten more pages! That's quite a lot. How are you going to do it?\n#Person2#: That's what I am trying to figure out. Now what can I do for you?
#Person1#: Do you know much about computers?\n#Person2#: Not a great deal. Why?\n#Person1#: I've been reading an article about computers. They are strange and are being used for almost everything.\n#Person2#: Yes. But have you learned how to use one?\n#Person1#: No. But I'm about to take a course on computers next term.\n#Person2#: That's good. You have to know about computers. Computer knowledge is a must whatever you do. You should learn quickly or you will be left behind.\n#Person1#: That's true. But first I want to learn the basics. In the library, there are computers. But it's a pity that I could not make use of them.\n#Person2#: Well, I can teach you the ABCs, if you like.\n#Person1#: That's very kind of you.
#Person1#: We'll be here in London staying in a newspaper office or teaching in a classroom full of chalk dust.\n#Person2#: Well, Tom, you'd be able to go out in the sunshine sometimes. You are a journalist. I am the one who has to stay in the classroom. Remember.
#Person1#: I may go grocery shopping later. \n#Person2#: We need to get food? \n#Person1#: I don't think we have any food. \n#Person2#: What are you going to buy? \n#Person1#: What food are we out of? \n#Person2#: Go and look in the kitchen. \n#Person1#: Could you look for me? \n#Person2#: You should just get the basics. \n#Person1#: What would that be? \n#Person2#: Get some eggs, milk, and bread. \n#Person1#: Would you please make a list for me? \n#Person2#: Okay, I'll write it down for you. 
#Person1#: Hi! Ben! Nice meeting you here! \n#Person2#: Hi, Terry! Nice meeting you here. \n#Person1#: What are you doing here? Fitness Consultant? \n#Person2#: Subscribe to the magazine for my wife. \n#Person1#: I see. I thought you had switched your hobby of stamp collection to fitness. \n#Person2#: No, I love collecting stamps. Hey, what are you doing here? \n#Person1#: I want to buy the newly issued stamps. \n#Person2#: I have spent all my money on that magazine, otherwise I will buy some myself too. \n#Person1#: Hey, do you have time this Sunday? I want you to come to my house. \n#Person2#: Sure. But can you tell me why?\n#Person1#: I want to swap some stamps with you. \n#Person2#: No problem. I will come by then. 
#Person1#: What would you like to order, sir? \n#Person2#: I'd like to try some Chinese food. \n#Person1#: We serve different styles of Chinese food here. But I'm not sure which one do you prefer. \n#Person2#: I have no idea. Could you recommend some to me? \n#Person1#: Well. Cantonese food is rather light, Beijing food is heavy, and Sichuan food is usually hot and spicy. \n#Person2#: Oh, I see. I'd like to have hot food. \n#Person1#: If so, I suggest you have a taste for Sichuan food. Most Sichuan dishes are spicy and hot, but they have different tastes. \n#Person2#: Really? So do you have some specialties? \n#Person1#: Yes. Roasted Crispy Chicken and Spicy Beef are our specialties. \n#Person2#: All right. I'll have them. 
#Person1#: Are you feeling better today, Bill? \n#Person2#: Well, it's hard to say. I cough a lot in the evening. \n#Person1#: You'd better give up smoking. It's bad for your health. \n#Person2#: You're right, but you know, it's hard to give up an old habit. \n#Person1#: But you should make up your mind first. \n#Person2#: You know, I often have to work till late at night. I need something to keep me awake. \n#Person1#: Why don't you go to bed and get up early? You'll have the same time for work. \n#Person2#: Thank you for your advice! I'll try it. 
#Person1#: it's such a nice day outside. Let's take a walk into town and do some window-shopping. \n#Person2#: you know I hate shopping more than anything else in this world. \n#Person1#: I know. But we could get some exercise in, and we could get some errands run, too. Window-shopping won't cost you anything. \n#Person2#: what kind of errands do we need to run? \n#Person1#: well, we could go to the newsagent's to pick up the Sunday paper, go to the butcher's to pick up a chicken for a roast dinner, and to the chemist's to pick up your prescription from the doctor. \n#Person2#: I'll only go if we can stop at the office-license to pick up something to drink for tonight. \n#Person1#: fine, we'll do that on the way home, so we don't have to carry it the whole time. \n#Person2#: sounds good. You have to promise not go into any of the stores in the mall though. I know how you like to try things on in the fitting rooms, especially if the stores have special offers. \n#Person1#: I promise. We're only going for a walk to get some exercise and to get some things done that we haven't had time for. \n#Person2#: ok, let's go then! \n#Person1#: do you have any money? \n#Person2#: for what? \n#Person1#: for our errands, and maybe a little extra for something from a vendor on the street. \n#Person2#: you said you were only going to window shop! \n#Person1#: I agreed to not go into the mall, but I can still look at things in the market! \n#Person2#: I should have known... 
#Person1#: Good evening, Martin. \n#Person2#: Hello, How good to see you. Did you have any trouble finding our place? \n#Person1#: Not at all. Your instructions were very clear. Where is Mrs. Martin? \n#Person2#: She is in the kitchen. Kate! Mrs. Gao is here ! \n#Person3#: Mrs. Gao! I am so glad you could come. My husband has told me so much about you. \n#Person1#: These are for you. \n#Person3#: Oh, what lovely flowers! You are very kind. Thank you so much. I will go and put them in some water right away. \n#Person1#: And here is a bottle of Chinese Mao-tai. \n#Person2#: That is thoughtful of you. I have heard that it packs quite punch. \n#Person3#: Mrs. Gao, would you like to start now? 
#Person1#: How are you doing, Andrew? \n#Person2#: Not well. I've been feeling pretty lonely lately. \n#Person1#: But you have so many friends! How could you be lonely? \n#Person2#: You know what they say'a friend to all is a friend to none'. I don't feel like I really know any of my friends. In fact, I should probably call them acquaintances, not friends. \n#Person1#: What about me? I'm your friend. \n#Person2#: I know you are, you are my girlfriend. I wish I had a guy friend to hang out with sometimes. \n#Person1#: I know what you mean. I find it difficult to make new friends, too. It's not as easy as it was when we were young, is it? \n#Person2#: Not at all. \n#Person1#: I've made a lot of new friends since I started learning English. Maybe you could join a club or take a class to make some new friends. \n#Person2#: That's a good idea. \n#Person1#: What kind of qualities do you look for in a friend? \n#Person2#: I'm not sure. I guess I'd like to meet some people who have a positive attitude and want to have a good time. \n#Person1#: People who play ultimate Frisbee have a positive attitude; maybe you should join the ultimate Frisbee club. \n#Person2#: That's a possibility. Thanks! 
#Person1#: Hello, Jenny. What's the matter? \n#Person2#: John, I'm hard up at the moment. Could you lend me five hundred yuan? I'll return it to you early next month. \n#Person1#: No problem, Jenny. Are you sure five hundred is enough? \n#Person2#: Yes. Thank you so much. 
#Person1#: Well, tell me something of yourself. \n#Person2#: What would you like to know, Mr. Green? \n#Person1#: What working experience have you got? \n#Person2#: In 2004, I got a job in the sales department of a trading company near Guangzhou. I started a sales rpresentative. A year later, I was promoted to the position of sales manager. I had that job ever since, which is just over a year now. \n#Person1#: Oh, good. Irene, can you tell me why you plan to quit being a sales manager to work here as my assistant? Don't you like your present job? \n#Person2#: Frankly, some part of it I enjoy very much , but I prefer something more professional. It happens that I have a friend working here in this company. She told me the export department was to recruit an assistant. I felt very excited at this news. That's why I'm here. 
#Person1#: Ok, Carrie, can you drive?\n#Person2#: Yes, I can.\n#Person1#: Do you have a drivers license?\n#Person2#: Of course.\n#Person1#: So, how long have you had your drivers license?\n#Person2#: I think I got it when I was 17, actually. Just before I went to college.\n#Person1#: Ok, how do you get a drivers license in your country?\n#Person2#: Well, I think it's changed, since I was a teenager. At that time you had to get a learners permit first and then you could start driving with your parents. You also had to go to drivers school, then you had to pass a driving test, and I think a written test as well.\n#Person1#: Ok, did you get a perfect score on your driving test?\n#Person2#: I can't remember my exact score, but I remember it was pretty good.\n#Person1#: Do all the members of your family drive?\n#Person2#: Yeah, 4 of us share our 2 different vehicles. I'm buying my own next week though.
#Person1#: Hello Madam, what can I do for you?\n#Person2#: My feet hurt. I think I need some new shoes.\n#Person1#: What size do you wear?\n#Person2#: The last time I bought new shoes was about a year ago and at that time I was a 7.\n#Person1#: Well. Once you get to be in your 20s your feet stop growing, so you're probably still a 7. But let's measure them just in case.\n#Person2#: OK. So what does it say?\n#Person1#: Well, it looks like urinate. No wonder your feet have been hurting you. You were been wearing shoes that are one size small.
#Person1#: Have you ever been to a school reunion?\n#Person2#: Uh yeah, why do you ask? Are you going to one?\n#Person1#: I'm organizing one for this summer. I have to make a reservation for a party room at a hotel. Do you know any good places?\n#Person2#: Why don't you try the Omni hotel, it often caters banquets or birthday parties but more important my brother works there.\n#Person1#: Could I ask you to check with him about the party rooms?\n#Person2#: Sure, I can do that. Maybe he can offer you a discount.\n#Person1#: Thanks. So what did you think about your school reunion? Was it fun?\n#Person2#: I didn't really enjoy mine. I'm not very good at making small talk, but it was nice to see old friends.
#Person1#: And what seems to be the trouble Miss Lee?\n#Person2#: I have a terrible pain in my stomach.\n#Person1#: I see, how long is this pain been occuring?\n#Person2#: Since late last night.\n#Person1#: I see, let me have a look, shall I? And what did you eat yesterday?\n#Person2#: We went to an American seafood restaurant and then we went to eat Chinese food, after that we had a lot of Italian things.\n#Person1#: Did you throw up or did you have the runs?\n#Person2#: Both.\n#Person1#: Well, that could be an upset stomach from over eating. Allergic to any drugs?\n#Person2#: No.\n#Person1#: Alright, take the medicine every 6 hours and stay in bed today.\n#Person2#: Thank you doctor.
#Person1#: Hello, Mr. James. I'm calling about your talk next month. It's getting close and there are a couple of things I need to check with you.\n#Person2#: OK.\n#Person1#: I need to know if you'd prefer to give your talk in the hall, the conference room or the lecture theater.\n#Person2#: I prefer the later if that's possible.\n#Person1#: That's no problem at all. Most speakers prefer that. And what about equipment? Is there anything special you'll need?\n#Person2#: Well, apart from the usual things like a white board and microphones, I'll need a CD player.\n#Person1#: I'm afraid we haven't got one. Would a cassette player do instead?\n#Person2#: Yes, that'll be OK.\n#Person1#: Right. I'll make a note of that. Oh, one more thing. Can I just confirm your fees? Was it 200 pounds?\n#Person2#: That's right.\n#Person1#: OK, that's fine. I'll pass that information to our accounts department and we look forward to seeing you on the nineteenth.
#Person1#: Sit down, please. What's wrong with you?\n#Person2#: I feel cold, and I'm shivering. I have a terrible headache and a sore throat.\n#Person1#: How long have you been like that?\n#Person2#: About a day.\n#Person1#: Let me have a look at your throat first. Please open your mouth and say ' ah '.\n#Person2#: Ah...\n#Person1#: And show me your tongue... Thank you. That'll do. You have slight tonsillitis, and your throat is inflamed. How is your appetite?\n#Person2#: Not so good.\n#Person1#: Now, let me take your temperature. Please put this thermometer under your armpit and let me feel your pulse?\n#Person2#: Your pulse is weak.\n#Person1#: Do I have a temperature, doctor?\n#Person2#: Yes, you have a high fever. I'd like to give you a blood test.
#Person1#: Good afternoon Miss, would you be interested in buying more life insurance? You know, you can never get enough.\n#Person2#: I think my husband has some.\n#Person1#: Are you sure he ' s purchased enough insurance for both of you? If something terrible happened with your husband, and he doesn ' t have sufficient insurance, my company does have a policy that could cover you and your husband if something happened to either of you.\n#Person2#: That ' s true. If something happened to my husband, I might lose everything. Both of us have to work to keep our home, car, and our children ' s education. I can ' t afford that by myself.\n#Person1#: Could we sit and look at the policy I mentioned and see if that ' s something suitable for you and your husband?\n#Person2#: Certainly.
#Person1#: You are an early bird, Tom. What do you do in the morning then?\n#Person2#: Exercise. The morning hours are the most precious period within a single day. We should not pass them up easily. Seize the time and do something useful.\n#Person1#: So, you choose to spend it on bodybuilding. Where do you exercise?\n#Person2#: Usually, I run to the Black Bamboo Park as a warm-up. Admission is free. Then I start my activities.\n#Person1#: Do you do the same exercises every day?\n#Person2#: No, I've deliberately kept a balance between various exercises ; parallel bars, push-ups, sit-ups, bunny-hops, five-kilometer run, and so on. I alternate them over the weekdays. Sometimes, when I find myself in a bad state, I will simply idle about in the park.\n#Person1#: Why don't you just stay in bed when you are feeling unfit for exercising?\n#Person2#: It's not easy to keep a good habit, you know. I fear that if I fail to get up early one day, I may find it still more difficult to rise early the next. Besides, a mere walk in the early morning is much fun, too. Here and there in the park, you meet whole gangs of senior citizens who might be singing operas or old songs, playing er'hu, chess, or just chatting and gossiping. It's interesting to join them.\n#Person1#: Oh, yes. Singing is also a good way of keeping fit, at least mentally.
#Person1#: Listen, Karen, I need your help. I don't know anyone here yet.\n#Person2#: I'm glad to help you. What's wrong?\n#Person1#: My mother-in-law just went into the hospital in L. A. Hank and I will be flying there tonight.\n#Person2#: I'm sorry to hear it. What's wrong with her?\n#Person1#: Doctors aren't sure yet. But the real problem is Suzy. She has a bad cold, and we don't want to take her with us. But we don't know who can stay with her.\n#Person2#: You need a babysitter.\n#Person1#: Yes, I'd ask Jill, the girl I've had before, but I need someone overnight. Maybe even for two nights.\n#Person2#: I could have Suzy stay at my place.\n#Person1#: I don't want to do that to you, Karen.\n#Person2#: Why not?\n#Person1#: Your own kids would get Suzy's cold. I think it would be better to have a good babysitter here. But I don't know who to ask. I need someone more mature than Jill. It might even be for two or three days.\n#Person2#: I know who we can ask. There is a girl I know, Sara Ralston. She is 17, and she will usually take this kind of job. I know her from my church, and I trust her completely.\n#Person1#: I'd like to talk with her. This is short notice, I know. But Hank and I are leaving tonight.\n#Person2#: I'll get you her number. I hope she can do it. She is very responsible.\n#Person1#: I'm glad you know someone. I knew you would be the best person to ask about this. I don't want to insult Jill or her mother. I think Jill maybe could do it. But I'd rather have someone a little older.\n#Person2#: I'll go home and get Sara's number. I'll call her first myself.\n#Person1#: Great. Then call me and let me know if she's free.
#Person1#: I ' m forming a music band.\n#Person2#: Do you already know how to play an instrument?\n#Person1#: Uh... Yeah! I ' Ve told you a thousand times that I ' m learning to play the drums. Now that I know how to play well, I would like to form a rock band.\n#Person2#: Aside from yourself, who are the other members of the band?\n#Person1#: We have a guy who plays guitar, and another who plays bass. Although we still haven ' t found anyone to be our singer. You told me that you had some musical talent, right?\n#Person2#: Yes, I ' m a singer.\n#Person1#: Perfect. So you can audition this weekend here at my house.\n#Person2#: Great! Wait here? You don ' t have enough room for the amplifiers, microphones or even your drums! By the way where do you keep them or practice?
#Person1#: Hey Rachael, what's up? How is your day?\n#Person2#: Not bad. We have had a big meeting today, remember?\n#Person1#: Oh, yea. I forgot. So how did it go?\n#Person2#: Pretty well. I think the boss liked my ideas.\n#Person1#: Great, so what happens now?\n#Person2#: Well, I have to write the proposal. I'm pretty excited about it.
#Person1#: Do you like cooking?\n#Person2#: I love it. I really enjoy creating a meal from various ingredients and watching my friends enjoy it. It gives me a real sense of satisfaction. Do you enjoy cooking?\n#Person1#: I don't like it. It takes up too much time and I really hate having to clean up after the meal. I can't stand doing the washing up, drying up, and putting all the dishes and cutlery away.\n#Person2#: You can ask the guests to help. My guests usually insist on doing the washing up. I just have to remind them where everything goes.\n#Person1#: So, what kind of dishes do you usually make? I know you like Italian food.\n#Person2#: Italian, Indian, and Chinese. I'Ve only recently started cooking Chinese meals and I need some more practice.\n#Person1#: Do you find it hard to get ingredients for Chinese food?\n#Person2#: Not at all. You can find most of them at supermarket. The ingredients are usually the same as in western food. The way that the food is prepared is the big difference, not the ingredients.\n#Person1#: How long does it take you to cook a meal for five or six people?\n#Person2#: Obviously, it depends on what I'm cooking, but I'd say it generally takes about one and a half hours.
#Person1#: When you need an apartment, where do you look for one?\n#Person2#: Our school has a link on its website for apartments.\n#Person1#: Can I share an apartment with someone?\n#Person2#: Some of the ads in the paper are from people looking for roommates.\n#Person1#: Are apartments expensive in this city?\n#Person2#: Do you need a single apartment, or is this for two people?\n#Person1#: I want a two-bedroom apartment.\n#Person2#: You can get that type of apartment for around fifteen hundred dollars a month.\n#Person1#: Would you have time to go look at apartments with me?\n#Person2#: I love apartment hunting. I'll be happy to go with you.
#Person1#: I'd appreciate it if you could help me pick out a gift for my daughter.\n#Person2#: Would she be interested in a laptop?\n#Person1#: That's exactly what I was thinking of.\n#Person2#: A Mac would be an excellent gift.\n#Person1#: I like Macs. How much for a Mac?\n#Person2#: You can take a 15 - inch Pro home right now for only $ 2, 100.\n#Person1#: A Mac it is. I'll take one home with me.\n#Person2#: She'll be very happy with this. And how do you plan to pay for it?\n#Person1#: I'll use my VISA, if that's okay.\n#Person2#: Now, if you'll just sign here, the Mac is all yours.\n#Person1#: Will she need anything besides what's in this box?\n#Person2#: Everything she needs is right here in the box.\n#Person1#: I appreciate your help. Maybe I'll be back for more computer stuff.\n#Person2#: Your daughter should get straight A's from now on. Good-bye.
#Person1#: Is it all right for me to come in now. Mr. Sutcliffe?\n#Person2#: Well. . . I'm pretty busy. but. . . all right. come in. What can I do for you?\n#Person1#: Do you mind if I sit down?\n#Person2#: Not at all. Take a seat. Now, what can I do for you?\n#Person1#: I want to leave the department. Do you think I could put in for a transfer?\n#Person2#: Yes, but why should you want to do that?\n#Person1#: Do you mind if I speak frankly?\n#Person2#: Not at all. Go ahead.\n#Person1#: Well, you see. I don't like the office. I don't like the staff. and I'm afraid you and I don't get on. So may I put in for a transfer?\n#Person2#: Yes. I'd delighted if you did.
#Person1#: Did you need help with something?\n#Person2#: I need to cancel an account.\n#Person1#: Do you have a problem with your account?\n#Person2#: I don't need two different accounts anymore.\n#Person1#: What are you going to do about the money in your account?\n#Person2#: Can I transfer it to my remaining account?\n#Person1#: I'll do that for you.\n#Person2#: That's lovely.\n#Person1#: Would you like to withdraw any money?\n#Person2#: No. That's fine.\n#Person1#: It'll just take me a moment to cancel your account.\n#Person2#: Thank you very much.
#Person1#: Do you want any meat today, Mrs. Bird?\n#Person2#: Yes, please.\n#Person1#: Do you want beef or lamb?\n#Person2#: Beef, please.\n#Person1#: This lamb's very good.\n#Person2#: I like lamb, but my husband doesn't.\n#Person1#: What about some steak? This is a nice piece.\n#Person2#: Give me that piece please, and a pond of meet, too.\n#Person1#: Do you want a chicken, Mrs. Bird? They're very nice.\n#Person2#: No, thank you. My husband likes steak, but he doesn't like chicken.\n#Person1#: To tell you the truth Mrs. Bird, I don't like chicken, either!
#Person1#: Jessie, I'm afraid I can't come back home for dinner tonight.\n#Person2#: Not back home for dinner again? That's the third time this week!\n#Person1#: I'm sorry. Our company has just opened. There are always too many things to handle. You know that.\n#Person2#: You don't have to explain. Suit yourself.\n#Person1#: I apologize. You have my word, I'll spend some time with you on the weekend. I promise.\n#Person2#: We'll see.\n#Person1#: Thank you for understanding. I promise I'll make it up to you.
#Person1#: It seems to me that you are on very good terms with him.\n#Person2#: We actually met at a dance party. He fell for me.\n#Person1#: He must be all over you the first time he saw you.\n#Person2#: He said that I put all other girls in the shade.\n#Person1#: That means he was head over heels in love with you.\n#Person2#: Well, he indeed likes me.\n#Person1#: But I think he can't hold a candle to you. I don't think he has ever popped the question.\n#Person2#: No, he is the sort of man who likes to hide his candle under a bushel.
#Person1#: At their last meeting, the stockholders voted unanimously to block the merger of our company with Blycore. All the executive committee was in favor of the merger. . . I don't understand how the stockholders could have so much power to throw a wrench in the plans. . .\n#Person2#: If they all unite on a certain issue, it's the stockholders who have the final say. You'd think it might be our CEO or the workers, but in fact, the stockholders control the money so they have the most power.\n#Person1#: Is it really that simple? It doesn't seem very efficient to run things that way. . .\n#Person2#: It might not be the most efficient, but if you think about it, it makes pretty good sense. The stockholders are our investors. They own the capital in our company, so they should have say about what is done with the company.\n#Person1#: I guess I'd buy that. . .
#Person1#: What do you do in your spare time?\n#Person2#: During the weekend I often take the family out on short trips.\n#Person1#: That sounds interesting.\n#Person2#: Yes, it helps me to relax.\n#Person1#: Do you have any hobbies?\n#Person2#: I like to paint. \n#Person1#: What kind of things do you paint?\n#Person2#: Mainly seascapes.\n#Person1#: What kinds of sports do you like?\n#Person2#: I like almost all sports, and I enjoy both playing and watching. I especially like tennis and mountain climbing. I was in the climbing club all through school.
#Person1#: Jenny, I was wondering if you, um. . . are you busy this Friday?\n#Person2#: Yes, Friday I have a class right after work.\n#Person1#: Oh. What about Saturday? Are you free then?\n#Person2#: Saturday my parents are coming to town. What's up?\n#Person1#: What about tonight? Do you have plans tonight?\n#Person2#: No. Did you want to go do something?\n#Person1#: Yes! Yes! I want to take you to dinner.\n#Person2#: Oh! That sounds great! How about six o'clock?
#Person1#: Have you had a chance to look over the contract?\n#Person2#: Yes. I've read it carefully.\n#Person1#: And do you have any questions?\n#Person2#: No. But the contract stipulates that I will teach 22 hours a week. Will you have thatmany classes for me right away?\n#Person1#: No, probably not. For the first two weeks you may teach 10 or 15 hours.\n#Person2#: But my salary will be 1100 dollars a month. Will you pay me that much for the first month? Because, I mean, I won't be working so many hours.\n#Person1#: I understand. That's why I didn't write the date on the contract. For the first two weeks, we will pay you according to the hours you teach. When you have 22 hours of classes, then the contract will take effect. Is that alright with you?\n#Person2#: Oh, so I don't sign the contract today. Is that right?\n#Person1#: I don't want you to misunderstand, Miss Briggs. We are very serious about hiring you. We want you to teach for us. We usually do contracts this way because it is more convenient.\n#Person2#: I can accept that.\n#Person1#: Good. And your benefits will begin immediately.\n#Person2#: Even my health insurance?\n#Person1#: Yes. We will apply for your health insurance tomorrow. And your free membership in the club starts today if you like.\n#Person2#: I have a few questions about the free membership.\n#Person1#: What would you like to know?\n#Person2#: Is my membership the same as paying club members? I mean, can I get discounts at club hotels?\n#Person1#: Absolutely. The only difference is in the restaurant and bar vouchers.\n#Person2#: What are bar vouchers?\n#Person1#: Paying club members get around 300 dollars a year in restaurant vouchers. The vouchers can be used in the restaurant or the lounge. But we don't offer vouchers to employees.\n#Person2#: But according to the contract, employees get a discount in the restaurant.\n#Person1#: That's right. So in a way, it is cheaper for you than for the members. You get more benefits than they do.\n#Person2#: So, for now, you want me to keep a copy of the contract. But we won't sign it yet. That right?\n#Person1#: Yes. I've prepared the contract just so that you understand everything. So that you understand the terms.\n#Person2#: I understand. And according to the terms on the contract, I am happy to accept this job. I look forward to it.\n#Person1#: I'm very pleased. We look forward to having you here, Miss Briggs.
#Person1#: Mary, it seems that your family and friends have been calling you recently, am I right?\n#Person2#: Yes, they have been concerned about me finding a job.\n#Person1#: What do they say?\n#Person2#: They want to recommend some jobs to me.\n#Person1#: Really? What jobs are they?\n#Person2#: My father wants me to work as a trainee in his company.\n#Person1#: It's great!\n#Person2#: My aunt says her company is in need of an assistant now, and she wants me to give it a try.\n#Person1#: This is a good opportunity.\n#Person2#: One of my friends tells me that his company is hiring in a large scale and he wants me to go for an interview.\n#Person1#: You can give it a try! May be you will succeed.\n#Person2#: I know. Let me think it over.\n#Person1#: If you have any good jobs, keep an eye for me!\n#Person2#: I will.
#Person1#: are you ready to go to the bank?\n#Person2#: sure, what do you need to do there?\n#Person1#: there's problem with my bank statement. There's a mistake on it. I also need to withdraw some money form the ATM.\n#Person2#: I have to exchange some money.\n#Person1#: that's right. You're going away next week.\n#Person2#: I also want to see if my salary has been paid into my bank account. There was a problem last week.\n#Person1#: I have to pay my credit bill too. If I don't pay it soon, the credit card company will charge me interest.\n#Person2#: their interest rates are usually quite high. It's a good idea to pay off your credit card debts before they attract interest.
#Person1#: We'll take the route No. 10.\n#Person2#: Fine. How many people are there in your party?\n#Person1#: Just two. How much does the trip cost?\n#Person2#: $ 200 for double.\n#Person1#: Is there any chance of a lower price?\n#Person2#: I am afraid not. Right now it's the tour season.
#Person1#: Mark? I need that file you took yesterday.\n#Person2#: I'm sorry, Janet. I left it at home. I'll bring it back in the morning.\n#Person1#: Mark, I told you yesterday afternoon that I would be using that file today.\n#Person2#: I know, Janet. I just walked out and forgot it completely. I'll go home and get it at noon, all right?
#Person1#: What's in the box?\n#Person2#: Sandy, I think we made a mistake. . .\n#Person1#: What do you mean?\n#Person2#: It's a cute little teddy bear!\n#Person1#: How sweet! Maybe he was just a shy guy who had a crush on you!\n#Person2#: And look what we did to him! Hey. . . he left me his business card.\n#Person1#: Wow! Call him tonight! You guys will really have an interesting love story to tell everyone!
#Person1#: Wonderland Travel, may I help you?\n#Person2#: Yes. I'm interested in your package tour to Paris. Could you tell me more about it?\n#Person1#: Certainly. The package includes air travel to and from Paris, accommodations, meals and transportation around the city.\n#Person2#: How long is the tour?\n#Person1#: It would be about a week.
#Person1#: Looking through your C. V. , I see that you graduated from Oklahoma State University. Can you tell me what training you have had that would specifically relate to the cable television Industry?\n#Person2#: Well, I'Ve attended some conferences in this field. But the most relevant training I'Ve had was in computer design. I believe I could integrate that knowledge with my college degree to design\n#Person1#: I see. Did you have anything specific in mind?\n#Person2#: Well, I notice that you currently provide an on-screen TV Guide. At the moment, it just scrolls the names of the programs in a repeated loop. If you have many channels, you have to wait a long t\n#Person1#: That's impressive. How would you make that pay?\n#Person2#: Tie it in with the pay-per-view services, and perhaps it could be a money-maker.\n#Person1#: I see you have several good ideas. Now, I just have a few questions about your C. V. I notice that there is a five-year gap between your last job and now.\n#Person2#: Yes, I took a break from work during that time. I had a baby, and as she was born with a handicap, I decided to suspend my career. But I have continued to keep up with the Industry through con\n#Person1#: So, you're just starting back. Maybe you'd better tell me a little more about your experience.
#Person1#: You heard who won the election, didn't you?\n#Person2#: Yeah. I am so excited that Obama won.\n#Person1#: I'm so happy that he did.\n#Person2#: That man just made history.\n#Person1#: Did you vote for him?\n#Person2#: I sure did! What about you?\n#Person1#: Of course I did!\n#Person2#: I am still in shock to know that he was elected.\n#Person1#: I am, too!\n#Person2#: I pray that he actually makes things better in this country.\n#Person1#: I'm sure that he will.\n#Person2#: I know he will, too.
#Person1#: Excuse me. May I have a bus map, please?\n#Person2#: You mean one for the city?\n#Person1#: Yes, within New York.\n#Person2#: I'm afraid we don't have any. If I were you, I'd try one of the newspaper stands.\n#Person1#: Thank you.
#Person1#: Can you tell me something about financial aid?\n#Person2#: What exactly?\n#Person1#: How to apply for it?\n#Person2#: In your first letter, that is, when you apply for admission, you should also tell them you need their financial aid.\n#Person1#: Then. . .\n#Person2#: If the aid is available, they will give you two or more application forms, One is for admission, the others are for the aid.\n#Person1#: What if not?\n#Person2#: They will tell you the aid is impossible.
#Person1#: Good afternoon, Ladies. May I help you?\n#Person2#: Can we have two a joining double room, sir?\n#Person1#: Have you made a reservation ladies?\n#Person2#: I'm afraid not.\n#Person1#: One moment, please. I have to check if there are room available. I'm sorry ladies. We have only two double room available, but they are on different floors. Would you mind that?\n#Person2#: We prefer they are on same floor because we have a problem check late that night.\n#Person1#: May I suggest family sweet? You all just have a consolation.\n#Person2#: what's it like?\n#Person1#: It's a big room with a king - size double bed and two single beds. You'Ve get also an roller-wheels.\n#Person2#: That's great. How much is it?\n#Person1#: 2000 Hongkong dollars per night plus ten percent service charge and five percent government tax.\n#Person2#: That's fine.\n#Person1#: But, ladies, the room's not yet ready. It will be delay about half an hour. Perhaps you can fill the registration form first. And rest at the lobby for a while. We'll let you know when the room ' s ready.\n#Person2#: Alright. thanks.\n#Person1#: Ladies, Hotel policy requires one nine of room charge as deposit.\n#Person2#: Do you take traveller's check?\n#Person1#: Yes, we do, Madam. Thank you, madam. Here's our welcome brochure with all of information of our facilities. My name is John. If you need any help do let me know. I'm at your service.
#Person1#: The job sounds great, but I'm a little worried about how much time it might take.\n#Person2#: It's pretty reasonable. It never took me more than five hours a week to do all the grading and then another thirty to forty minutes to record the grades on the computer.\n#Person1#: That sounds manageable. I guess you can do the work when it fits into your own schedule, too, can't you?\n#Person2#: Oh, yah, you can do the grading in your room or in the library. You just need to get each set back for the next class, but that means you always have at least two days and sometimes four.\n#Person1#: It sounds great.\n#Person2#: Good luck with your interview.
#Person1#: You don't look happy. What's up?\n#Person2#: It's the computer assignment. John and I teamed up to do the project together. But so far we've done only half it.\n#Person1#: Well, you'd better hurry up.\n#Person2#: I know. But actually, John is not doing anything. I don't know how to say it to him. He's having problems with his parents and has been quite upset these days.\n#Person1#: But it's supposed to be his work as much as yours. I suggest you talk to him. And let him know that he should share the work.\n#Person2#: Yes. I think I'll share the work.
#Person1#: Excuse me. Can you help me?\n#Person2#: Yes?\n#Person1#: I have a ticket to Seattle. How do I get there?\n#Person2#: I can't help you here. You have to go to the ticket counter. Follow this passage to the end, turn left and go three hundred yards. You'll see a sign that says, 'Check In'. Then look for the airline you want.\n#Person1#: Can you repeat that, please?\n#Person2#: Sure. Go down this hall till you come to the end. Go left till you see the big sign over- head that says' Check In'. There'll be lots of counters for the different airlines. You go to the one where you have your ticket.\n#Person1#: Go down this hall to the end. Then go left?\n#Person2#: That's right. Here, I'll draw you a map. Sometimes it's confusing.\n#Person1#: Thank you.\n#Person2#: My pleasure.
#Person1#: Jim, thank goodness you've arrived. The class report started half an hour ago. And I was just beginning to worry.\n#Person2#: I'm sorry I'm late, Ellen. This morning has been a real mess. I didn't think I was going to make it here at all.\n#Person1#: Why are you late? Our whole report depends on those drawings you're holding.\n#Person2#: Yes, I know. I'll tell you about it later. First, let's see how we're doing for time. Two groups are still ahead of us, aren't they? The re- port on the rights of the consumer and the analysis of the stock market. That means I've got about 20 minutes to warm up.\n#Person1#: You do look cold. What happened?\n#Person2#: I've been standing outside in cold temperatures for over an hour waiting for a bus.\n#Person1#: Over an hour? But I thought your apartment was only a ten-minute bus ride to campus.\n#Person2#: Under normal conditions, but the bus was delayed because of the weather. And when I stepped into a drugstore to call home for a ride, the bus went by. As luck would have it, there was no one home so I had to wait for another 45 minutes for the next bus.\n#Person1#: That's Murphy's law, isn't it? What was it said? 'If anything can go wrong, it will.' Well, we've still got 20 minutes to gather our wits together.\n#Person2#: We'd better stop talking. People are turning around and looking at us
#Person1#: Excuse me. I am from STM. We are carrying out a survey on the traffic in our city. Do you mind if I ask you some questions?\n#Person2#: No, not at all. Go ahead.\n#Person1#: Good, thanks. What do you do, sir?\n#Person2#: I am a teacher. I teach children French.\n#Person1#: Great. Do you live far from the school? I mean, how do you usually go to work?\n#Person2#: Well, mostly by car. But once in a while, I prefer to ride my bike. You know, I live quite far from the school, about 20 miles. And I have to spend about an hour riding to school. But it only takes me less than a quarter of an hour to drive my car, unless the traffic is very bad.\n#Person1#: I see. Does this happen often? I mean the bad traffic.\n#Person2#: Yes, sure! I often get stuck on the way, and the problem's getting worse and worse.\n#Person1#: That's all of my questions. Thank you very much.\n#Person2#: You are welcome.
#Person1#: Hello, Roger? This is Ann.\n#Person2#: Hi, Ann. How have you been? And how's your new apartment working out?\n#Person1#: Well, that's what I'm calling about. You see, I've decided to look for a new place.\n#Person2#: Oh, what's the problem with your place now? I thought you liked the apartment.\n#Person1#: I do, but it's a little far from the campus. Do you think you could help?\n#Person2#: All right. So, what kind of place are you looking for?\n#Person1#: Well, I'd like to share an apartment with one or two roommates within walking distance of school.\n#Person2#: Okay, how much do you want to spend on rent?\n#Person1#: Oh, somewhere under $ 200 a month.\n#Person2#: Hmm. And anything else?\n#Person1#: Yeah, I need a parking space.\n#Person2#: Well, I know there's an apartment nearby. I'll drop by there on my way to class today.\n#Person1#: Hey, thanks a lot.\n#Person2#: No problem.
#Person1#: Hi, Mark, how are you?\n#Person2#: Actually, I am really fed up, Linda. It's Jane.\n#Person1#: Jane? Who's Jane?\n#Person2#: Oh, nobody really. Just a most stunningly attractive girl in my year school.\n#Person1#: Oh, is that all? So what's the problem?\n#Person2#: Well, the thing is I just don't know how to make her notice me. Or ....\n#Person1#: Wait a minute. I've got a brilliant idea. Why don't you try talking to her?\n#Person2#: But I wouldn't know what to say. I ....\n#Person1#: Look. She is in your chemistry class, isn't she? You are good at chemistry. You could offer to help her with her chemistry homework. How about that?\n#Person2#: Not bad. Just one problem.\n#Person1#: What?\n#Person2#: She is better than me at chemistry.\n#Person1#: Ok, then. Well, there is that party at John's at Friday night. You could invite her.\n#Person2#: Just another small problem. John's her boyfriend.
#Person1#: I was almost fooled by a telephone call yesterday.\n#Person2#: What's it about?\n#Person1#: A week's vacation for two. But I realized it was a cheat when they told me to ring a special telephone number to claim the price.\n#Person2#: Well,those calls are charged at unbelievably high rates.
#Person1#: Did you go see the doctor about your cough?\n#Person2#: The doctor said if I keep smoking it will increase my chance of having a heart attack or lung disease. And I am thinking about quitting smoking as the problems seem to be quite serious.
#Person1#: Hello, Tom. I haven't seen you for some time. How are you doing?\n#Person2#: Oh! Not too bad. I have been busy writing an article.\n#Person1#: Really? Have you finished it?\n#Person2#: Yes. I finished it yesterday.\n#Person1#: Congratulations! Are you doing something this evening?\n#Person2#: No, nothing important. Why?\n#Person1#: Well, do you feel like going to a concert? I have two tickets.\n#Person2#: Oh. Good idea. I want to do something relaxing, and I like music very much.\n#Person1#: Great. I'll meet you at your house at seven. Is that OK?\n#Person2#: OK! See you at seven.\n#Person1#: All right. See you then.
#Person1#: You're just left school, haven't you, Emily? \n#Person2#: Yes, I finished last Friday. \n#Person1#: You sound relieved. \n#Person2#: Well, yes. I don't mind admitting that I am. I enjoyed school, but I did object to having to go in every day once we've done all our exams. \n#Person1#: Well, what are you going to do now? Have you made any plans? \n#Person2#: Yes, I intend to go to university. That'll be in September. But it all depends on my A level results. \n#Person1#: You mean getting into university actually depends on your passing your A level subjects? \n#Person2#: Oh, yes. 
#Person1#: I need to go to the bank. \n#Person2#: But they are closed today. \n#Person1#: Closed? Are you kidding? What is it , some kind of holiday today? \n#Person2#: Have you already forgotten? What's the date todoay? \n#Person1#: Oh, it's the first of April, April fool's day \n#Person2#: You forgot all about it , didn't you? \n#Person1#: So I have, but I has reminded me at least one thing I need to remember. \n#Person2#: What's that? \n#Person1#: Tomorrow is my wife's birthday. \n#Person2#: Better not forget that, so kill you if you don't get her something. 
#Person1#: What can I do? \n#Person2#: The system crashed when I was surfing on the internet. \n#Person1#: Did you go to any illegal website? \n#Person2#: No, But does that matter? \n#Person1#: Yes, your computer can be easily infected by virus if you do that. \n#Person2#: I see. I'd better never try. \n#Person1#: That's wise. \n#Person2#: Do you know what's wrong with my PC? \n#Person1#: One minute. Oh, yes, it was infected by a virus, and you had no antivirus software. \n#Person2#: Is anti-virus software necessary for a PC? \n#Person1#: Of course. You'd better learn something about it. \n#Person2#: I'm afraid yes. But what about the data I stored in the computer? \n#Person1#: Don't worry, it should have been protected automatically. And I take an anti-virus software with me. Do you want me to install it now? \n#Person2#: Yes, please. I'll really appreciate that. 
#Person1#: Hey, Sandy, what's new? Interested in a movie tonight? \n#Person2#: I wish I could, but I'm busy. I'm going to work at a soup kitchen tonight. \n#Person1#: Soup kitchen? Is that a new restaurant or something? \n#Person2#: Nah, it's a place where homelesspeople go to eat. \n#Person1#: How did you get involved in something like that? \n#Person2#: Well, the minister at my church told us about it, and it seemed interesting. I thought I'd try it once, and if I didn't like it I'd stop. \n#Person1#: So what do you do there? \n#Person2#: It's simple. All we do is prepare some food, usually sandwiches and some fruit, and give it out to them at the soup kitchen. \n#Person1#: Yeah, it sounds easy. How long does it take? \n#Person2#: Only about two hours, for a couple of days a month. Why don't you give it a try? \n#Person1#: I don't know. I mean, I like helping the community and all that, but I don't know if I have the time... ... \n#Person2#: Come on, it's easy, and it'll make you feel good. Why don't you come with me tonight? 
#Person1#: Hello. you have reached the Furniture Warehouse. How can I help you?\n#Person2#: Hello. Yes, I need to schedule a delivery of a sofa next week. I ordered it online yesterday, but I won't be home this weekend to receive it.\n#Person1#: That's no problem, sir. What day next week would be best for you?\n#Person2#: How about Wednesday?\n#Person1#: OK, Wednesday. Wednesday is July twenty fifth, right?\n#Person2#: Yes, I believe so.\n#Person1#: Great. Our team can deliver the sofa sometime between 9:00 AM and 3:00 PM.\n#Person2#: Wow! Can you be more specific? I'm not going to be home all day, just in the morning.\n#Person1#: Oh, I see. Well, I will make sure they arrive before noon.\n#Person2#: OK. Thank you.
#Person1#: Hi, Linda, this is John. What are you doing tonight?\n#Person2#: Hi, John. Nothing much. It's Friday and I'm bored. I don't have any plans yet. What do you have in mind?\n#Person1#: How about going to the movies?\n#Person2#: Is there a good movie to see?\n#Person1#: Let me surf the Internet. Do you want to see a comedy or a drama?\n#Person2#: Nothing sad or depressing. I had a hard work week. I want to see something funny.\n#Person1#: I agree. Work was stressful for me, too. There aren't any new comedies right now. I only see dramas and horror movies.\n#Person2#: Hey, let's go to a comedy club. My favorite comedian is performing tonight at the local theater. It starts at 7:00 PM. Let's do dinner, too.\n#Person1#: OK. I'll meet you at your house at 5:00 PM.
#Person1#: Hi, Jeannie, why have you come to school an hour early?\n#Person2#: I wanted to get a front row seat and review one more time before the test, because I failed a course last term. Why you here so early, Jack?\n#Person1#: I get out of my car here at this time everyday. You seem to be nervous about your lessons. Have you finished your review?\n#Person2#: I've only been studying night and day for the last week. If I don't get an A in this class, I won't get the support of my country. Why do you seem so calm?\n#Person1#: This class is really just a review for me. I've been learning it for 2 years.\n#Person2#: That's lucky for you.\n#Person1#: Jeannie, can you guess what the test will be like? Will it be difficult?\n#Person2#: I hope not, but I'm still worried about it.\n#Person1#: Well, cheer up. Hope for good luck.\n#Person2#: Thanks for wishing me luck. I'm going to need it.
#Person1#: I am having trouble with my job.\n#Person2#: What is the problem?\n#Person1#: I have been asked to work with five other people on a project, but no one is working together on it.\n#Person2#: So, your group is having a problem with teamwork?\n#Person1#: Yes, and I don't know what to do with it.\n#Person2#: When is your project due?\n#Person1#: We have to finish it until next week.\n#Person2#: Is there anyone who is in charge of the team?\n#Person1#: No, everyone is just doing their own separate work on it.\n#Person2#: If your group does not have a leader, you should step up and be the leader.\n#Person1#: How do I do that?\n#Person2#: You should call everyone together for a meeting, so they're all in one place.\n#Person1#: And then what should I do when I have them altogether?\n#Person2#: Let them know that this project is important, and so is working as a team to get it done.\n#Person1#: I will ask them what they have done so far.\n#Person2#: That is a good idea.
#Person1#: It's Saturday tomorrow, so what's your plan?\n#Person2#: I'm so exhausted this week. I'll stay at home and relax myself.\n#Person1#: You mean you'll get some sleep and watch several NBA games huh?\n#Person2#: Yes, especially the game of Cavaliers.\n#Person1#: Why do you love NBA games so much?\n#Person2#: NBA games are exciting, the outcome can be changed in only a few seconds. And there are fascinating skills, how about you? What will you do this weekend, go skating as usual?\n#Person1#: I'm worn out, too, and I'll stay in the dormitory and see some videos about skateboarding.\n#Person2#: How long have you been skateboarding? 3 years or 4 years? I don't remember it exactly.\n#Person1#: About 4 years, during those 4 years I watch videos about skateboarding and practice the skills once and once again, you may feel it boring and painful, but I take delight in it. Every advancing skills brings me a great sense of fulfillment, every time I jump into the sky, I feel I'm flying.\n#Person2#: Wow, amazing.
#Person1#: Are there any special requirements on the project? And shall we talk around it in details?\n#Person2#: Yes, there're some samples in our office and you can take some to study it. Besides, you see, in recent years, we've visited a diversity of factory buildings all over the world and we hope that our building is the perfect match of advanced technology and attractiveness.\n#Person1#: That's a good idea. We can improve our technology to meet your special need.\n#Person2#: And please let white color dominate.\n#Person1#: OK! I've noted it down. And any others?\n#Person2#: Oh! I've almost forgot the location was transferred to the A county in the east of the city.\n#Person1#: I'll tell them.\n#Person2#: Well, the most important thing is that our company demand the quality be exactly the same as the sample which you'll take from the office on the third floor.\n#Person1#: Please feel assured that we'll abide by our promise. And we'll do everything we can to ensure delivery.\n#Person2#: Thanks a lot. And I believe I'll have a good time working with you.\n#Person1#: I think so. Bye!\n#Person2#: Bye!
#Person1#: What are we going to do? I can't get the car out of this ditch. I'm stuck!\n#Person2#: I'm worried, Tom. I haven't seen any other cars for almost an hour.\n#Person1#: I know. This is terrible. What can we do? This snow doesn't stop falling!\n#Person2#: I told you we should have stayed in town today.The weather report said 100 percent chance of snow.Why did you want to come up here?\n#Person1#: I wanted to show you the cabin. We only had another half-hour to go.\n#Person2#: Well, now we're stuck. What can we do?\n#Person1#: I don't know.\n#Person2#: I've heard that when this happens, it's important to save energy.\n#Person1#: What do you mean?\n#Person2#: We're stranded here, Tom. We may be here a long time.We need to conserve the gas in the car. The car's energy is what will keep us warm.\n#Person1#: I have plenty of gas.\n#Person2#: Yes, but the gas and the battery both have to stay working.We can't just let the car run and run.If we do, it will die soon. Then we'll freeze.\n#Person1#: So what can we do?\n#Person2#: Turn the lights off.Then, run the car and the heater only about fifteen minutes every hour.That will conserve the heat as long as possible.\n#Person1#: Alright. That's a good idea.\n#Person2#: I wish we hadn't come up here. Now we'll probably be here for days.\n#Person1#: Days?\n#Person2#: Yes, it happens.That is what happens in big snowstorms. People get stranded for days.\n#Person1#: Oh, my God! It's good we have food.\n#Person2#: Probably we'll survive.But turn the car off for about forty-five minutes. Then we'll turn it on again.
#Person1#: How would you describe your ideal job?\n#Person2#: I think the job should make use of the professional experience I have obtained, and offer me opportunity for advancement.\n#Person1#: Why do you think you might like to work for our company?\n#Person2#: I feel my background and experience are a good fit for this position and I am very interested.What ' s more, your company is outstanding in this field.\n#Person1#: What makes you think you would be a success in this position?\n#Person2#: My graduate school training combined with my experience as an intern should qualify me for this particular job. I am sure I will be successful.\n#Person1#: How do you know about this company?\n#Person2#: Your company is very reputed in this city. I heard much praise to your company.
#Person1#: Good morning. Craftsman Company. Can I help you?\n#Person2#: Yes, good morning. This is Mr. Suzuki from Video TV. May I speak to Mr. Johnson?\n#Person1#: I'm sorry, but Mr. Johnson is out at the moment. Can I take a message?\n#Person2#: Uh, yes, okay. Tell him John Suzuki called. That's S-U-Z-U-K-I.\n#Person1#: Yes.\n#Person2#: From Video TV.\n#Person1#: Yes, Video TV.\n#Person2#: Tell him I telephoned. I'd like to see him about the videotapes. Can he call me this afternoon?\n#Person1#: Yes, Of course. What's your telephone number?\n#Person2#: It's, area code 413, 447-9626.\n#Person1#: That is 413-447-9662?\n#Person2#: No, that's 447-9626.\n#Person1#: Oh, I'm sorry, 447-9626.\n#Person2#: Yes, that's right. Extension 162.\n#Person1#: Extension 162. Okay, Mr. Suzuki. I'll give him the message.\n#Person2#: Thank you. Good-bye.\n#Person1#: Good-bye.
#Person1#: Can I help you, sir?\n#Person2#: Yes, I'd like a book about law.\n#Person1#: Would you tell me the name of the book and the author?\n#Person2#: Uh, the Origin of Law. And it's written by Professor Felix of Harvard.\n#Person1#: I'm sorry. It's out of stock now. Could you come by again next week?\n#Person2#: Next week? It is too late. I need it urgently.\n#Person1#: Well, then, is it convenient to leave your phone number so that I can inform you as soon as we restock it?\n#Person2#: No, thanks any way.\n#Person1#: You're welcome.
#Person1#: Steven, what's the expense of moving house?\n#Person2#: About 3 000 dollars.\n#Person1#: It costs a lot of money. Hospital bills had already made deep in-roads into our savings. Do you think the rest of your salary will be enough to cover our daily expenses?\n#Person2#: I am afraid not, darling. Our expenses are mounting.\n#Person1#: We have to cut back on our shopping from now on.\n#Person2#: Don't worry. Maybe I can find a part-time job to increase my income.\n#Person1#: I hope so.
#Person1#: I think you should look over these figures again. There are some calculations that are a bit off.\n#Person2#: I apologize. This should not have to be this way.\n#Person1#: Apology is accepted. Try to do better next time.\n#Person2#: Of course, I should have been more careful. I'm sorry.
#Person1#: Aren't you interested in watching the Olympics? There have been some excellent performances by athletes from all over the world.\n#Person2#: I just don't find it very interesting.\n#Person1#: I think it's wonderful to see people from all over the world taking part in such a great event.\n#Person2#: I think that for a lot of people, it's just a way to try and show their country is better than other countries.\n#Person1#: I think the Olympics help to promote world peace.\n#Person2#: I'm not sure about that. We still have many wars in the world. I think that the idea behind the Olympics is a good one, but the reality is that during the Olympics countries compete. There's no real spirit of cooperation and people are usually not very friendly to each other.\n#Person1#: You are so pessimistic! The Olympics is a great opportunity for athletes to demonstrate their speed, skill, agility and strength. Most people hope to see someone from their country win, but I think that they are just happy to see good performances by any athlete.\n#Person2#: Well. I think that the most amazing performances are by athletes who participate in the Paralympics.\n#Person1#: Now there we are in agreement!
#Person1#: What do you do in your spare time?\n#Person2#: I have many hobbies. I like almost all kinds of sports and I also like to listen to classical music.\n#Person1#: What kinds of sports do you like?\n#Person2#: I like playing basketball. Basketball is a very exciting game because it keeps you alert and I also enjoy the team spirit of basketball.\n#Person1#: Who is your favorite author?\n#Person2#: I like the novels of Dickens very much. I've read almost all of them in Chinese translation.\n#Person1#: Are you a music lover?\n#Person2#: Yes, I like listening to Beethoven's works.\n#Person1#: What kinds of films do you enjoy?\n#Person2#: I like all kinds as long as they are exciting.
#Person1#: What's the news on our website? How effective do you think it is from a marketing standpoint?\n#Person2#: We've been able to survey and track some of the information of our website users through some cookie technology, and it's surprising to see the results.\n#Person1#: What kinds of hits are we getting on our company's website?\n#Person2#: From the numbers, it seems nearly half of the visitors who stumble onto our page pick up the link not from network browsers or search engines, but from our circular insert. That means our consumers are purposefully and actively seeking information about our products and services through the web format. Based on these findings, I am completely convinced the internet is the marketing power of the future!\n#Person1#: You really think that many people turn to the internet to find product information. What about the old standbys of word mouth and print media?\n#Person2#: Well, these mediums are still important. . . they aren't a thing of the past. . . But I think they might be less important now than in the past. The technology age has arrived!
#Person1#: Hey Bobby. What's going on?\n#Person2#: Just taking a smoke break.\n#Person1#: I forgot my cigarette today. Do you have another one?\n#Person2#: Sure. Here you go.\n#Person1#: Thanks.\n#Person2#: I didn't know you smoked.\n#Person1#: Really? I've been smoking for over a year now.\n#Person2#: Oh. You're new to smoking still. I've been smoking for 7 years.\n#Person1#: You ever tried to quit?\n#Person2#: Many times. I'm really addicted. It's harder to stop than you think.\n#Person1#: Yeah. I tried to quit last month, and I thought it was going to be easy, but it turns out that I'm still smoking.\n#Person2#: I highly recommend you quit soon. The longer you smoke, the harder it becomes to quit.\n#Person1#: I think you're right. Aright. Gotta go to class. Thanks for the cigarette. I'll talk to you later.\n#Person2#: No problem. I'll talk to you later.
#Person1#: Would you like to drink some coffee?\n#Person2#: No, thanks. I have some trouble with my heart, my doctor recommend I to drink less.\n#Person1#: Would you like to try some watermelon juice? It tastes good.\n#Person2#: All right
#Person1#: Hi, Celia! How was your trip to the United States?\n#Person2#: It was terrific. I really enjoyed it.\n#Person1#: Great. How long were you away?\n#Person2#: I was there for about three weeks.\n#Person1#: That's a long time! Was the weather OK?\n#Person2#: Yes, most of the time. But it snowed a lot in Chicago.\n#Person1#: So, what was the best thing about your trip?\n#Person2#: Oh, that's difficult to say. But I guess I liked Nashville the best.
#Person1#: Have we handed out all the water?\n#Person2#: Yes. So what else to do now?\n#Person1#: Nothing. The teacher said the only thing left was to get back all the disposable cups later.\n#Person2#: I see. How do you like the game?\n#Person1#: Terrific. There is one girl said, It is the best game I've ever watched.\n#Person2#: Who do you think do better?\n#Person1#: Clive was really outstanding. Not only he put on a big show himself, but also he inspired the whole team.\n#Person2#: Exactly. He is unbelievable.\n#Person1#: On the other hand, I think the other team won everyone's respect. The leader said they could have crumpled at the beginning, but they just carried on and never lost their cool.\n#Person2#: They were really tough.\n#Person1#: The thing I like most about them is that they did not play with a heavy heart even though at that time the odds seemed to be against them.\n#Person2#: I can't agree more. Okay, time is up. Let's do the last thing.
#Person1#: We have mild wines and strong liquors. Which kind do you prefer?\n#Person2#: I've no idea. I'd like to listen to your suggestion.\n#Person1#: It's my pleasure. Actually, it's really hard to say as individual tastes are different. As for myself, I'd like to recommend gin and tonic.\n#Person2#: Well, I'll try gin and tonic.
#Person1#: hi, betty!\n#Person2#: hi, Andy, how are you finding your new job?\n#Person1#: pretty good. My colleagues seem alright. So far everything is great.\n#Person2#: that's nice. What do they have you doing over there?\n#Person1#: well, I work in the marketing department. The corporate culture is totally different from my last employer. Before, when I was assigned a task, I was totally on my own but here most of the work is don\n#Person2#: that's really good. It's very important to feel like you are part of the team at work.\n#Person1#: indeed. Team work is highly valued in this new company. I like our boss too. He is easy to get along with treats everybody with respect and appreciation. He's highly respected by all his employees.\n#Person2#: that's great, that's good for a positive work environment and helps motivate employees. I wish my boss was like that.\n#Person1#: true, take my former supervisor as an example. He was extremely controlling and overbearing. He always had to micromanage everything.\n#Person2#: well, now you don't have to worry about that. This new place sounds really good.\n#Person1#: yeah it is.
#Person1#: Welcome to our shop. It seems you are interested in this dress.\n#Person2#: Yes. But I am afraid it is too thick to wear in summer.\n#Person1#: That's no problem. It is made of linen, so you won't feel hot in it. I can assure you it is of superior quality. What is more, it is very popular with young women.\n#Person2#: How much is it?\n#Person1#: 88 Yuan.\n#Person2#: OK, that is reasonable. I will take it.
#Person1#: Hi, Sir. What can I do for you?\n#Person2#: Hello, there. I'd like to know about Clean Collection. My company in the US is going to send me a cheque. It's for my wages, but I'm not too sure about how to cash it here.\n#Person1#: Right. If the cheque is coming from the US, into a local currency account it will take 7 working days to clear.\n#Person2#: Is there any way we can speed it up?\n#Person1#: There is, actually. If you can get your company to apply for a cheque from a bank in Shanghai, that'll speed things up no end.
#Person1#: Since China was open to the outside world, its trade forms have become much more flexible. One of these commonly used forms is co-production. Would you please do a bit explanation of it, Mr. Walker?\n#Person2#: Well, under this arrangement two parties cooperate to manufacture a product or a category of products, for example, machine tools for export. Each party produces and supplies a part of the components and parts ; one party is a Chinese enterprise, the other, an overseas firm. Most probably, the foreign counterpart contributes technology and equipment, and sometimes, parts and components, while the Chinese enterprises factory building, labor and other resources to the cooperative production. They join hands and fulfill orders together by an agreement or a contract.\n#Person1#: I suppose that the assembling of these components and parts, particularly the marketing of the finished products should take place in China.\n#Person2#: Not necessarily. It depends on the contract stipulations. They may be marketed in the foreign country where the other party is located, or even in a third country.\n#Person1#: I think the principle of co-production is to expand export trade. It's a reciprocal business, isn't it?\n#Person2#: Yes, you are right. Either party is not well-equipped to produce the final products single-handedly, but they can enter into an agreement. In such case, each side contributes different resources to make the manufacture of a certain product or a category of products possible.
#Person1#: Besides salary what kind of allowance can I expect?\n#Person2#: We have a kind of floating bonus on a yearly basis.\n#Person1#: Can you elaborate it more concretely?\n#Person2#: Yes. Floating bonus is the kind of bonus that is indeterminate in amount, such as quarterly bonus, bonus at the end of the year.
#Person1#: Professor, excuse me, but I need to leave early.\n#Person2#: What seems to be the problem?\n#Person1#: I am not feeling well.\n#Person2#: What is bothering you?\n#Person1#: I think I am beginning to have an asthma attack.\n#Person2#: Would you like someone to walk you over to the Student Health Center?\n#Person1#: No, I think that I should just go home because I have some medicine there.\n#Person2#: Do you need a ride home?\n#Person1#: I live in the dorms across the street, so I'll be OK.\n#Person2#: OK, then, hope you feel better soon. Check your e-mail for missed assignments.
#Person1#: Are you going to watch the Indy Five Hundred on TV this weekend?\n#Person2#: I'm not really into race car driving.\n#Person1#: You were when we were in high school. That, and baseball.\n#Person2#: Yeah, well, times change. Look at you! You're a father of three kids now. You can't say that you haven't changed any.\n#Person1#: True, but I still have to watch my baseball. The season's in full swing now.\n#Person2#: I mean, I know spring training's over, but I'm just not into all that.\n#Person1#: Hello? Is the real Taylor in there?
#Person1#: I would like to buy one round trip plane ticket to Hong Kong, please.\n#Person2#: For what days, madam?\n#Person1#: Leaving on September 5th and returning to New York City on October 9th.\n#Person2#: Do you prefer an aisle or a window seat?\n#Person1#: I prefer to sit next to a window.\n#Person2#: How would like to pay?\n#Person1#: I have a Master Card.\n#Person2#: I have booked you for one window seat on American airline flight No. 409. Have a good trip!
#Person1#: May I help you? Miss!\n#Person2#: Yes. I'd like to look at lipstick and eye shadow.\n#Person1#: What color set do you prefer?\n#Person2#: Well, brown.\n#Person1#: We have a beautiful selection of eye shadows this fall. Look at the colors. Aren't they beautiful?\n#Person2#: But they're purple. I prefer a brown set.\n#Person1#: If you insist, I can show you the brown sets. I'll have to warn you that they're very ordinary, though.\n#Person2#: Well, I'm not so sure. Most of my make-up is brown.\n#Person1#: Why don't you wear purple eye shadow for a change? We also have lipstick to go with it.\n#Person2#: Can I try it?\n#Person1#: Sure. Are you wearing any make-up?\n#Person2#: No.\n#Person1#: Have a seat, please. Now, here is the mirror. How do you like it?\n#Person2#: Not bad. Actually, it makes me look younger. I like it.\n#Person1#: Try the lipstick as well. See, how fresh and charming you look.\n#Person2#: You're right. I'll take them all.
#Person1#: It's Mrs. Bardot, isn't it?\n#Person2#: Yes, it is. But I'm afraid we haven't met before.\n#Person1#: I'm Greg Wu, Head of Consultancy. I see that you'd like a credit check done for your company. Is that right?\n#Person2#: Hello Greg. Yes, that's correct. You see, we have just acquired a new partner, the transaction is huge. It's to be signed next month, and we would really like to have some clearer information about them.\n#Person1#: I see. So, it's not for your company, it's for the prospective partner?\n#Person2#: That's right. I feel it's always better to go in with both eyes open, if you know what I mean.\n#Person1#: I couldn't agree more. If you have the company details with you I can get on with that right away. Is there anything else that you need from us today?\n#Person2#: The lady at the desk, Shelly I think, told me you offer many other consultancy services.\n#Person1#: We do indeed. Such as making trade investments, financial consultancy, and of course the service you requested.\n#Person2#: That's good to know. Thanks for your help today, I'll leave you with the details and you can get started.
#Person1#: Good evening, sir. Are you Mr. Jim Stewart from the States?\n#Person2#: Ah, yes, that's right.\n#Person1#: Glad to meet you, Mr. Stewart. I'm the guide from Pacific Tour Agency. My name is Zhang Hua.\n#Person2#: Hello, I was just looking for the guide.\n#Person1#: I'm always at your service, sir. By the way, did you have a pleasant trip?\n#Person2#: Not bad. But I've made too many flights these days. I could hardly remember how many take-offs and landings I've been through these three days. I think we all feel a bit tired.\n#Person1#: Well, shall we go to the hotel right now? I've already made a reservation for you.\n#Person2#: Wonderful. I'm eager to take a sauna as soon as possible.\n#Person1#: So we must get you to the hotel as soon as possible. I hope to see you refreshed and revitalized tomorrow morning, as we are going to visit the Great Wall.\n#Person2#: I am sure we will. Actually, we are looking forward to seeing the great wonder.\n#Person1#: Come this way, please. The coach is waiting outside.\n#Person2#: Fine, let's go.
#Person1#: The portions here are man sized. We usually end up taking half of the meal home with us.\n#Person2#: Everything looks so good. Is there anything in particular that you recommend?\n#Person1#: Hey, sis. You know me, if I don't like everything on the menu, I don't go back to the restaurant!\n#Person2#: So you're saying I can't go wrong with anything I order? In that case. . .\n#Person1#: Wait, you love salmon, don't you? They have the best salmon pasta.\n#Person2#: That sounds really good! Does it come with a soup?\n#Person1#: Soup and bread and salad bar! I'm telling you, these people know how to keep you coming back!\n#Person2#: I see what you mean!
#Person1#: Didn't you write a paper about Albert Kahn last semester?\n#Person2#: Yes, for my history of architecture class.\n#Person1#: Oh, I am taking it now and I have to do some research on industrial architecture. I need to read up on Kahn's factories. So I would like to see what you wrote about them.\n#Person2#: I don't think my paper will help; I focus on his classical design like Clements library and office buildings, but you are interested in the modern building he is famous for.\n#Person1#: Yes he is best known for his factory, especially the auto plants in Detroit. He made a breakthrough in industrial design. You know before his time, factories were so cmp3ped and inefficient but his factory provide enough light and air and open space. So the cars could be assembled in one huge plant.\n#Person2#: I remember reading that previously, factories had wooden frame and the heavy machinery made the buildings vibrate and there were fire hazards too. But when Kahn started to design auto plants around the turn of the century, reinforced concrete had just been invented. Talk about the breakthrough, not only were the buildings sturdy and fireproof but they were cheap to put up too!\n#Person1#: You seem to know a lot of about his industrial career.\n#Person2#: Actually even though I wrote about his other works, I did a lot of background reading. Let me see if I can dig up that paper for you. There were some books of articles included in my bibliography that you might want to look up at the library.
#Person1#: Good morning, Sir. How can I help you?\n#Person2#: I wonder if you could tell me some information about active holidays.\n#Person1#: Active holidays, Sir? Can you tell me exactly what you mean, please?\n#Person2#: Well, you see, when I go on a holiday, I like to get plenty of exercise. I don't like staying around and doing nothing. I gut enough of that in my office. What I mean to say is I'm the sort of man who enjoys swimming, water skiing, that sort of thing. I like anything to do with water and I don't mind roughing it. I've always been used to looking after myself. When I was in the army, I used to get up at five every morning just to see the sunrise.\n#Person1#: Yes, Sir, very interesting. Um... active holidays, let me see. Oh, yes, what about skin diving, Sir? We can offer you a fortnight off the coast of Cornwall, all--including one week skin diving and one week shark-fishing with the local fishermen. It's a very good bargain.\n#Person2#: Shark-fishing? I don't think I fancy shark-fishing. Is there any chance of getting a bit of sailing in that part of Cornwall?\n#Person1#: We don't do any sailing holidays, Sir. They are mostly organized by the sailing schools. But rowing, canoeing, yes. Are you fond of rowing, Sir?\n#Person2#: Well, I did a lot of rowing when I was at university, but I'm a bit out of practice these days. I don't think I've handled a pair of oars since I went boating on the Thames ten years ago. No, I don't think I'd like to spend my holiday rowing.\n#Person1#: Try looking through some of these brochures, Sir, and see if there's anything that attracts you.
#Person1#: Operator, connect me with the cashier please. Miss, I want to check out. Will you please have the bill ready for me? I'll come down in a few minutes.\n#Person2#: OK. Sir, I'll bill you right away.\n#Person1#: Operator, sorry to bother you again. Will you please send me a porter to carry my luggage downstairs?
#Person1#: Hey. What's this on Facebook? It says ... Are you getting married?\n#Person2#: Yeah. Didn't you know that?\n#Person1#: No. Why didn't you tell me about it? It says you're getting married next week.\n#Person2#: Yeah, and I'm bringing her over to mom's house tomorrow. You'll love Jasmine.\n#Person1#: Jasmine?\n#Person2#: Yeah. Here's her picture on Facebook.\n#Person1#: Oh. Wow.\n#Person2#: What? What do you mean?\n#Person1#: Dad is not going to be impressed.\n#Person2#: Why?\n#Person1#: She's got, like a lot her tattoos and a nose ring, and uh, I'm sorry. The family is going to be really surprised.\n#Person2#: Ah, she's so, well, so sensitive and caring.\n#Person1#: Um, well .... \n#Person2#: What?\n#Person1#: Have ... have you taken any marriage prep classes?\n#Person2#: Ah, who needs that anyway? I know all about women.\n#Person1#: Yeah. Right, like .... What have you had? Like ten girlfriends in the last six months?\n#Person2#: Well, that's different!\n#Person1#: Uh, listen. Obviously, you need to improve your communication skills, and the best thing at this point .... if you're really set on marrying Jamie...\n#Person2#: Jasmine ...\n#Person1#: Okay, I'm sorry, Jasmine, anyway, um, you really should take a marriage prep class.\n#Person2#: What? What you are talking about? I know all about love and romance.\n#Person1#: Uh. Right ....\n#Person2#: What? What do you mean?\n#Person1#: Look. Okay. It's more than that. What do you know about, say, personal finance?\n#Person2#: Well, you know ...\n#Person1#:  I mean, how are you going to manage your money together? Are you going to have a joint bank account? Whose salary is going to pay the bills?\n#Person2#: Ah, no problem. No problem. We have that figured out. My paycheck is going to be automatically transfered to her overseas bank account.\n#Person1#: Oh. \n#Person2#: What?\n#Person1#: Uh, where exactly is this account? What's the name of the bank?\n#Person2#: Ah, I don't know. Jasmine's going to take care of that.\n#Person1#: Oh, boy. Right. Um, well, what about children? Are you guys going to have any kids?\n#Person2#: Well, I want a large family, so eight kids would be just about right.\n#Person1#: Wow! What does Jasmine say about that?\n#Person2#: Ah, well, she doesn't want any kids, but I'll change her mind once we get married.\n#Person1#: Right. \n#Person2#: No problem.\n#Person1#: Okay, what about housework? How are you going to handle that?\n#Person2#: Well, Jasmine won't mind doing it.\n#Person1#: Did she said that?\n#Person2#: Well, not exactly. We've been just so busy planning out our honeymoon, that we just haven't worked out, you know, these small details.\n#Person1#: Great! You know what? By the time you learn her last name, I think things are going to be over between the two of you.\n#Person2#: No, you just want and see.
#Person1#: Hi, Nice to see you again!\n#Person2#: Hi! I haven't seen you for quite a long time. What are you doing these days?\n#Person1#: I'm taking a country music course.\n#Person2#: Oh, really? How interesting! What are you learning from the course?\n#Person1#: A lot of things, you know, such as the history of country music, singing, and how to play a guitar.\n#Person2#: That's great. Well, talking about country music reminds me of a famous singer, John Denver. Have you ever heard of him?\n#Person1#: Sure. His song 'Country reads take me home' is popular both in the USA and in China.\n#Person2#: Yes, that's true. Did you hear the had news about him?\n#Person1#: what was it?\n#Person2#: He had an accident while flying his plane alone, and he was killed.\n#Person1#: That's a big loss for country music.
#Person1#: Well, madam, the first and the most important thing I have to tell you is that there is really nothing seriously wrong with you, physically that is. The analyst's report shows that basically you are very fit.\n#Person2#: So, why is it that I'm always so nervous... tense... ready to jump on anybody-my husband, children, and colleagues?\n#Person1#: I think your condition has a lot to do with your habits.\n#Person2#: Habits?\n#Person1#: Yes... now tell me, madam, you smoke, don't you?\n#Person2#: Yes, I'm afraid I do, doctor.\n#Person1#: And, very heavily, I imagine.\n#Person2#: Yes, quite heavily.\n#Person1#: What do you eat normally?\n#Person2#: I'm a good eater. Yes, I'd say I'm a good eater. But usually, I don't eat breakfast.\n#Person1#: That's bad for your health. I think you should get up early and have breakfast. And, another question, do you get up early?\n#Person2#: No, I usually get up at 9:00 a. m. I get up late because I go to bed too late. I stay up late watching TV till the midnight.\n#Person1#: What sport do you usually do?\n#Person2#: I don't like sports. But sometimes I play cards with some friends, that may be my sport.\n#Person1#: I think, madam, for your health, you'd better change your way of life.
#Person1#: Come to my office, Billy. Look at your messy hair. This is the third time you have been late for class within this week. And every time you went in, you disturbed the teacher's class.\n#Person2#: Sorry, Miss. I didn't mean to do that, but it was my alarm clock that didn't wake me up.\n#Person1#: That is not a proper excuse. You could set it ahead of the exact time so that you could have got up earlier and not have been late.\n#Person2#: I did that, but it seemed useless when I found the batteries had run out after I woke up this morning. I rushed to school and luckily, my neighbour Mr. Green gave me a hand and took me to school with his car.\n#Person1#: So you could have made it. But you were still late for class.\n#Person2#: The thing is, when I got off, I found I had left my bag in his car. And it was too late to get it back when I realized that. I went straight to the nearest shop and gave him a call. I waited for five minutes before Mr. Green drove back.\n#Person1#: Finally, he gave you your bag and you came to the classroom and you were already 15 minutes late for class at that time. Is that all?\n#Person2#: Miss, you seem to know the entire story. May I go back to class now? Otherwise I will be late for the following class.
#Person1#: Sometimes I think television is too biased. None of them are completely objective. \n#Person2#: That's unavoidable, but think, How wuuld you keep up to date without television? \n#Person1#: Newspapers or the radio I guess. I just wish TV was more objective. \n#Person2#: Look, you can still learn a lot from watching television, you just need to be smart when you're watching. Filter the information and decide if you believe what you are hearing or not. \n#Person1#: The internet's a lot worse. \n#Person2#: Really? Why? \n#Person1#: There's no one moderating it. Anyone around the world can put information onto the net for anyone else to see. The information on the internet is mostly unsubstantiated and you can never know who has written it, or why. A lot of people get conned online. \n#Person2#: Again, you need to think carefully. If you don't trust others online, have nothing to do with them. 
#Person1#: Have you heard the big news? \n#Person2#: What big news? \n#Person1#: Olivia and Nicholas are engaged! He proposed to her last night at a fancy restaurant. \n#Person2#: I didn't even know they were dating! . \n#Person1#: After Nicholas' ex-girlfriend cheated on him, they realized that they had a great friendship and that maybe they were meant to be with each other. \n#Person2#: They really are perfect for each other. I can't think of a better-matched couple than them! \n#Person1#: I heard that they are planning to have an extravagant wedding ceremony in a church with a reception in an expensive restaurant on the lake. \n#Person2#: Have they asked anyone to be in the wedding party yet? \n#Person1#: I think Nicholas asked Jack to be his best man and Olivia asked Kaitlyn to be her maid of honour. They both have big families, so their siblings will be the bridesmaids and groomsmen. \n#Person2#: It sounds like they've done a lot of planning in a very short time. Have they decided where they are going to go for their honeymoon? \n#Person1#: I haven't heard where they will go yet, but I bet you they will go to a beach somewhere; you know how they both love surfing. \n#Person2#: You know, most people find it difficult to find their soul mate, but they've made it seem extremely easy! 
#Person1#: Don't be too sad. If you really think that you have no feeling with him, then, in my opinion, getting divorced maybe is the best way to solve the problem. \n#Person2#: I know clearly at the bottom of my heart. I just can't set my mind at rest because of the child. She's little. She cannot understand us and accept such truth. \n#Person1#: Yeah, child is the matter. Don't tell Jenny the truth, only tell her the white lie. When she grows up, you find the suitable opportunity to tell her. \n#Person2#: I see. OK. 
#Person1#: I will take the coat. Do you receive checks? \n#Person2#: Yes, of course. \n#Person1#: Here you are. Please give me a receipt. \n#Person2#: Sorry, sir, you have to pay in the check-out counter. It's there. \n#Person1#: OK, please wrap it for me first. 
#Person1#: Dalian is a beautiful city. Do you agree? \n#Person2#: I suppose I do. \n#Person1#: The climate here is pleasant. \n#Person2#: You said it. \n#Person1#: This city is really comfortable to live in. \n#Person2#: It sure is. \n#Person1#: No other city can match it. It's heaven. \n#Person2#: Well, if you live in other cities as long as enough, you will love them just as much. \n#Person1#: Maybe. \n#Person2#: That's for sure. 
#Person1#: Excuse me,I'd like to buy a guitar.Could you recommend one? \n#Person2#: Sure.Do you want an acoustic one or an electric one? \n#Person1#: An acoustic one. \n#Person2#: Are you looking to get a steel-string or a classical? \n#Person1#: What's the difference? \n#Person2#: Well,a classical guitar has nylon strings and its neck is bigger than a steel-string guitar's.It's best suited for finger picking .A steel-string is best for playing chords. \n#Person1#: I'm mainly interested in learning to play rhythm guitar. \n#Person2#: In that case,I'd suggest a steel-string guitar.The best one we have is the Ovation. \n#Person1#: This one's a little too expensive for me.I'd prefer something cheaper for now.When I've learned to play ,I might get a better one. \n#Person2#: In that case,how about this one?It's inexpensive but it's still well made and easy to play. \n#Person1#: Hmm.All right,I'll take it,and this book on how to play the guitar as well. \n#Person2#: You should also get a couple of guitar picks. \n#Person1#: Oh,right.Thanks for your help. \n#Person2#: Don't mention it. 
#Person1#: Hello, Bill. Nice to see you again. I heard you went into hospital for a few days. I hope everything is OK.\n#Person2#: Yes, fine. I was really nervous just before I had the operation, but strangely enough, the operation was over when I woke up.\n#Person1#: It must have really hurt afterward.\n#Person2#: Well, the nurse gave me plenty of pain killers, but it did feel uncomfortable. I wasn't permitted to eat anything for 48 hours. That was the worst thing.\n#Person1#: I bet you are ready for a nice big steak when you got out of hospital.\n#Person2#: I certainly was. However, the doctor gave me a list of food I couldn't eat for another 72 hours. And steak was on the list.\n#Person1#: Did they take good care of you in the hospital?\n#Person2#: Oh, yes. The nurses were very kind. Though they were strict about what I could drink, in the end, I just drank water and nothing else. How I wish to drink some beer now!
#Person1#: Hi, Mary, you are in Boston, too. I remember you are admitted to Washington University. And are you meeting someone at the airport?\n#Person2#: Glad to meet you here, Bob. I am meeting my parents. You are paying a visit to your grandparents?\n#Person1#: Right, have you graduated from the university?\n#Person2#: No, I will graduate next year. My sister Carol will get married this weekend, so I come here to attend her wedding.\n#Person1#: How time flies! I haven't seen her for years.
#Person1#: What's your problem? You seem to have been thinking of something.\n#Person2#: I was thinking of the test tomorrow. I'm afraid I can't pass this time.\n#Person1#: Cheer up. You've been working pretty hard these days, there's no doubt that you'll pass.\n#Person2#: Actually, I'm just worried about the pressure, I always feel nervous as soon as I enter.\n#Person1#: Try to relax, with the help of deep breathing. You can remove the pressure gradually. Take your time when you start to work. You'll feel much better in this way.\n#Person2#: Thanks for your kind advice. You seem to be fully prepared for the test don't you?\n#Person1#: I don't wait until tests come. If you work hard regularly, you are always ready for tests.\n#Person2#: Nice talking with you. Have a good day.\n#Person1#: You too, and good luck tomorrow.
#Person1#: Only 2 months to go, so what are you going to do after graduating from college?\n#Person2#: My uncle has a company. He'll give me a job. I want to gain some work experience there.\n#Person1#: How long do you plan to work there?\n#Person2#: Just one year. Then I'll look for another job.\n#Person1#: Why won't you just worked for your uncle?\n#Person2#: Because I want to go to London and work there. You know the competition is very fierce there. With some work experience, I can find a job there more easily. So what's your plan?\n#Person1#: I'll find a job in this city and work here for one year. Then I'll go back to college to get my degree in business.\n#Person2#: Are you interested in working for my uncle?\n#Person1#: Thanks. But I've applied for 3 jobs.\n#Person2#: Have you got any replies?\n#Person1#: Yes, 2 of them have offered me a position.
#Person1#: Dad, you love me, don't you?\n#Person2#: Of course I do. Why do you ask? What's on your mind?\n#Person1#: Well I saw this great offer for a free cellphone here in the newspaper and...\n#Person2#: Free? Nothing's ever free.\n#Person1#: Well, the phone is free after a $50 Mail in rebate.\n#Person2#: Ah, so that's the catch, and why do you need a cellphone anyway?\n#Person1#: That all my friends have one and I can use it to call you in case the car breaks down.\n#Person2#: Oh, I don't know, there are always so many fees.\n#Person1#: But the monthly charge for this service is only $29.99 with one thousand free weekday minutes nationwide and unlimited weekend minutes, plus unlimited anytime minutes for anyone using the same service.\n#Person2#: I don't know.\n#Person1#: And you can run over the extra minutes, so the next month instead of just losing them. What do you think of that?\n#Person2#: Yes, but what are the terms of the service agreement?\n#Person1#: It's only for 6 months.\n#Person2#: But what if you cancel early?\n#Person1#: Umm there's a cancellation fee of $200, but with...\n#Person2#: 200 bucks?\n#Person1#: Yeah, but you won't have to worry about me while I'm driving the new car.\n#Person2#: New car? What new car?\n#Person1#: The new car you'll need to buy so I can use the cellphone. I mean, what's it gonna look like if I'm using a cellphone in our old lemon.\n#Person2#: Teenagers. What do they think of next?
#Person1#: Hi, Mr. Matthew. This is Susan Millers speaking from Chicago. Now we'd like to place an order with you.\n#Person2#: Oh, very glad to hear that. When can you send your purchase order?\n#Person1#: We will send it as soon as possible. We hope you can hurry on the order.\n#Person2#: No problem. But I'll have to check another purchase order, which is to be finished this Friday. Now I'm in Shanghai on business. Anyway, I'll let you know when I come back, and then we can sign a contract.\n#Person1#: Thanks.\n#Person2#: Well, I'm afraid we can't send the products until after the Christmas Holidays. We will begin our holiday in New York next Tuesday and our company will be closed for 2 weeks.\n#Person1#: That's alright. We'll try to have a meeting for the details of the order and send it to you this Thursday. I hope you tell your market manager about it.\n#Person2#: OK. Once we get our purchase order, we will begin preparing your bookings.\n#Person1#: Thanks. We need the products in one month.\n#Person2#: Fine.
#Person1#: I'd like to do some shopping, but I was told London is an expensive place to live.\n#Person2#: That's not completely true. If you shop in the right places, you can live cheaply. Here is a market list. You can buy all kinds of things in these markets had a low price.\n#Person1#: That's great.\n#Person2#: Let's see East Street Market sells cheap food and clothes. It's open from 8:00 am to 5:00 pm.\n#Person1#: Yes, but how can I get there?\n#Person2#: By underground. You can get off at the Castle station. Now look at the Leather Lane market. That's a good central London market for food and clothes. It's open at lunch times from Monday to Friday. It's near Chancery Lane station.\n#Person1#: What about Brixton market?\n#Person2#: It has a wide variety of vegetables from all over the world. It opens from 9:00 am to 6:00 pm everyday.\n#Person1#: Oh, it's close to Brookston station, very near my place. Great! It's very convenient. I like it.\n#Person2#: That's good. And here is the Karman Height market. It's a good place for buying presents. It opens on Sunday only.
#Person1#: Did you lock the doors?\n#Person2#: All except the back door. I left that open for Tim. He took the dog for a walk.\n#Person1#: Well, I'm going on to bed. I'm beat.\n#Person2#: Okay. I'm going to stay up a while. I've got to go over the household budget. We're a little overspent this month.\n#Person1#: Please tell Tim to close the door to the basement. I don't want the dog down there tonight.\n#Person2#: Okay. Good night. See you at breakfast.
#Person1#: Put all baggage on the conveyor belt. Walk through the detector age one at a time, please.\n#Person2#: Excuse me, ma'ma. Could you walk back through the doorway again, please?\n#Person1#: What for?\n#Person2#: Airport security. Could you empty your pockets over here, please?\n#Person1#: Really? I'm in a hurry. All right.\n#Person2#: Ah, a set of keys.\n#Person1#: I'm embarrassed! I forgot completely about them. I'm terribly sorry.\n#Person2#: That's all right. Enjoy your flight.\n#Person1#: Thank you.
#Person1#: There are so many eating utensils on the table. Which ones do I use first?\n#Person2#: Use them from the outside in.\n#Person1#: I see. A set for appetizers and another for the main course.\n#Person2#: Right. We do the same thing at home. Don't you remember?\n#Person1#: Oh yeah. The big napkin goes on my lap.\n#Person2#: Let's look at our menus.\n#Person1#: Cindy, help me order because I'm still not very familiar with American cooking.\n#Person2#: Well, we order appetizers first and then entrees.
#Person1#: That's all the general information of our company. I think you already have good knowledge about our company.\n#Person2#: Yes, I have an overall understanding.\n#Person1#: When we have the final results, we will call you.\n#Person2#: Then when will I get a reply at the latest?\n#Person1#: If you pass the interview, the personnel department will inform you within two weeks.\n#Person2#: But if I don't pass, will you call me?\n#Person1#: I'm sorry we won't. You can wait for two weeks. If you don't get a telephone call, it means that you weren't successful.\n#Person2#: Then do I have the chance to get this job?\n#Person1#: I'm sorry but I can't make the final decision myself, and I have to discuss it with other interviewers.\n#Person2#: I know. No matter what the result will be, I have learned a lot from our conversation.\n#Person1#: Your mentality is very good and that's great.\n#Person2#: Thanks for giving me the opportunity of this interview.\n#Person1#: My pleasure.
#Person1#: Do you get the news that our company is trying to find out new tactics to test us?\n#Person2#: I know something about it. Our company often organizes all kinds of lectures to improve our professional skills.\n#Person1#: It takes most of our weekends to listen to these boring lectures, so I can not bear it anymore. It is said that they think out some tests to check our management skills.\n#Person2#: Is that true?\n#Person1#: Definitely!\n#Person2#: If that information is exact, I guess our company is willing to promote someone.
#Person1#: Why didn't you call me last night?\n#Person2#: Because I went out.\n#Person1#: Why didn't you phone me from a callboy?\n#Person2#: I didn't have any change.\n#Person1#: Tell me why you didn't come to see me tonight then.\n#Person2#: I don't like all your questions. That's why.
#Person1#: I like to open up a savings account please.\n#Person2#: O. K. We offer a few different kinds.\n#Person1#: I want the one with the highest interest rate.\n#Person2#: That would be our Saver's Plus account.\n#Person1#: 4. 5 %, that's good. How much money do I have to keep in it to get that rate?\n#Person2#: You have to maintain a balance of $ 10, 000 in the account or the rate drops to 3 %.\n#Person1#: All right. I'll open one of those.\n#Person2#: Just fill out these forms, and I'll be with you in one second.\n#Person1#: Thanks.
#Person1#: I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but it's that time of year again. Have you got your performance evaluations finished yet?\n#Person2#: Oh no! Evaluations! You can tell that's not my favorite job ; I haven't even started yet. When is the deadline for turning in thecompleted forms?\n#Person1#: Well, you do still have three weeks. But remember the employee must sign them, too. Filling them in is nothing - it's meetingwith the employees that takes so much time.\n#Person2#: I never know how to rate the employees'work. Of course attendance and productivity are easy, I just look at the sales figures.\n#Person1#: So it's the subjective criteria like team building and colleague support that you find hard?\n#Person2#: Exactly! Attitude. . . how do you rate attitude?\n#Person1#: I suggest letting each employee fill out his or her own evaluation for those items. Then, based on their self - assessment, you can add your comments. It's a great starting point for discussion\n#Person2#: Great idea. And after all, that's the whole point of an evaluation. I almost can't wait to give it a try.
#Person1#: Do you like cooking?\n#Person2#: Yes. I like cooking very much. I got this hobby when I was 12 years sold.\n#Person1#: Why do you like it?\n#Person2#: I have no idea. I like cooking by myself. I like to taste delicious food.\n#Person1#: That's wonderful!\n#Person2#: And I love trying new recipes, which I usually test with my friends. You can come, too.\n#Person1#: Really? I hope I can have a chance to taste it. Don't forget to tell me.\n#Person2#: Certainly.
#Person1#: I'm reading an interesting report on Mars.\n#Person2#: Oh, what does it say? Does it say water could still exist under the surface of Mars?\n#Person1#: Absolutely! It says there is water on Mars buried beneath the surface. It's just a matter of how deep it is.\n#Person2#: Then could the soil on Mars somehow be fertile enough to grow simple plants?\n#Person1#: The soil would need quite a bit of fertilizer to grow anything. And it would need to be protected from the UV radiation.\n#Person2#: Actually, we are doing a project in school that involves landing a ship and staying on Mars for an extended period of time. Does NASA have any type of portable habitats that could be used to stay on the planet?\n#Person1#: I'm not sure NASA has built any portable habitats for extended stays on Mars, but they have looked at various designs.\n#Person2#: One of the most exciting things about Mars is that there could have bean life on it. What are your personal opinions on the life on Mars theory?\n#Person1#: Well, I'm not really an expert in this area, but my understanding is that anything is possible. It's just that it is so hard to determine what went on 4. 5 billion years ago.\n#Person2#: But maybe there is a chance of gradually improving the surface and atmosphere of Mars so it may be inhabitable by humans.\n#Person1#: I'm skeptical. Mars is made of rocks containing silicon, iron, and various minerals. It also has an atmosphere of carbon dioxide. It is so different from what we have on earth, you know.\n#Person2#: I'd still like to hope that some day we could set up a human colony there.\n#Person1#: But there are still other big problems we need to solve such as prolonged weightlessness, food storage, and a series of physiological effects.
#Person1#: you look better today. How did your test go?\n#Person2#: much better than it did yesterday.\n#Person1#: did you pass?\n#Person2#: I not only passed my test, but I aced it! I'm so happy!\n#Person1#: you should be. You worked really hard last night preparing for it.\n#Person2#: thanks for helping me with it. If you hadn't encouraged me to do my best, I wouldn't have ever been able to pass.\n#Person1#: you don't have to thank me. It's just a part of my job as your counsellor.\n#Person2#: did you always do well at school?\n#Person1#: no, in fact, I was terrible at taking exams.\n#Person2#: really?\n#Person1#: sure, but my teachers always encouraged me to do the best that I could and that helped me a lot. When are your final exams?\n#Person2#: I'll get my finals in two months.\n#Person1#: when do you plan on studying for those exams?\n#Person2#: most students just cram the night forehead.\n#Person1#: do you think that's a good idea?\n#Person2#: no, I think I should study a little bit at a time, starting a few weeks before the exam.\n#Person1#: that sounds like a good idea. What are you going to do if you have any questions while you're studying?\n#Person2#: I'll go and talk to my professor or a learning support assistant.\n#Person1#: it sounds like you've learned something useful this year!
#Person1#: What are the seasons like in your city?\n#Person2#: Summers is hot and usually lasts a long time. Winters are short, but cold, wet, and windy. I love the summers in my city, but I hate the wintertime.\n#Person1#: Does it ever rain in summer?\n#Person2#: We usually get a big thunderstorm every two weeks, but apart from that, summers are dry. Thunderstorms make the air fresh again, so most people don't mind then.\n#Person1#: What are spring and autumn like?\n#Person2#: I like spring because flowers bloom and trees grow leaves again. In spring, the weather is very changeable-sometimes cold, sometimes warm. It's usually windy with some rain. Autumn is usually sunny an\n#Person1#: Well, I live in the southern hemisphere, so our summertime is your wintertime, and vice versa. We get some rain in every season, but most is in winter. In winter, it sometimes gets cold, but our wine\n#Person2#: Do you usually go on a summer holiday?\n#Person1#: No, I don't. I go on a winter holiday instead. I go somewhere warm.\n#Person2#: I usually go on holiday during the spring or the autumn. I try to go somewhere where the weather is more reliable than in my city.
#Person1#: Hi, Nancy. How are you doing?\n#Person2#: Hi, Tom. Want a cup of coffee?\n#Person1#: Not right now. I've got to get another car and my old one is blown up.\n#Person2#: Oh, hey, did you look in the classified ads?\n#Person1#: You mean used car?\n#Person2#: No, Ah. . . single sellers.\n#Person1#: Well, yeah, but I'd be getting somebody else's problem.\n#Person2#: Uh huh. How about a used car? They've got good ones now.\n#Person1#: It's the same kind of deal though, you know, you never know what you're going to get.\n#Person2#: Oh, hey, how about a new car? They've got easy loans now. You'd feel so good driving a new car.\n#Person1#: Let's look at them all. Have you got a paper there?
#Person1#: And lots of Dear Abby sob stories. . .\n#Person2#: Hey! I learn a lot from the psychologists who give advice in those columns!\n#Person1#: No wonder you're such a wacko. . .\n#Person2#: Whatever. . . Smell! Perfume samples!\n#Person1#: Nice. Hey, I like the layout of this page. . .\n#Person2#: You mean, you like the pictures of the beautiful models. . . Hello?
#Person1#: Hello, Is this EYE computers?\n#Person2#: Yeas, It is. Sewen Jes speaking. How can I help?\n#Person1#: Actually, I'm calling to complain about your service. The computer I bought last week is faulty.\n#Person2#: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that, sir. What exactly is problem?\n#Person1#: Well, easily, It doesn't work. It doesn't even start probably.\n#Person2#: Oh, dear! I'll do whatever I can.
#Person1#: It's very kind of you to show me around.\n#Person2#: Not at all. What would you like to see first?\n#Person1#: I really don't know.\n#Person2#: Let's walk around the lake first, shall we?\n#Person1#: Yes, that would be lovely.\n#Person2#: Have you been here before?\n#Person1#: No, it's the first time I've been here.\n#Person2#: I will take you to Li River after walking around here.\n#Person1#: That's wonderful! I have heard the scene of Li River is beautiful!\n#Person2#: Yes, you'll be in a different world there.
#Person1#: Hello, how are you today. Here for your six month check-up?\n#Person2#: I'm fine, Dr. Beecham. Yes, just a cleaning and check-up today.\n#Person1#: Oh, fine. Let's take a look.\n#Person2#:  She probed my teeth and checked my gums.\n#Person2#: Well, it looks like you have a cavity and your crown is loose. We need to fill that cavity before it gets any worse and the crown needs to be refitted. Make an appointment for next week and I'll take care of them.\n#Person2#: Okay, I'll do that, but my crown was just put on last year. Will my dental insurance cover the work?\n#Person1#: Since you had that done here, we'll take care of it. There won't be a charge. And, your insurance should cover the work on the cavity. Now, I'm going to have the hygienist do your cleaning and I'll see you soon for the other work.\n#Person2#: Thanks, doctor.
#Person1#: Hello, this is Peter Dixon from NEZ news radio. May I speak to Mr. Wilson please?\n#Person2#: Yes, speaking.\n#Person1#: Good morning, Mr. Wilson. I'm calling to confirm the date of the next interview program.\n#Person2#: Hold on a minute please. I'll have my assistant check that part.
#Person1#: You look really wiped out.\n#Person2#: I had meetings back to back all morning. Then the printer broke in the middle of putting together the Six Soap presentation, and the phone rang off the hook from the minute I walked into the office.\n#Person1#: Not a good day, I hate to tell you that Mr. Emory wants to see the designs for the Polish Paste Ad tomorrow morning.\n#Person2#: I can't believe it! I guess I'll be here until ten again tonight!
#Person1#: Happy New Year, Bill.\n#Person2#: Happy New Year, Steven.\n#Person1#: Do you have any plans for the New Year holiday?\n#Person2#: My whole family are going to Hainan for visiting. What about you?\n#Person1#: How happy you are! I have to stay at home to prepare my final exam.
#Person1#: Welcome. What can I do for you this morning?\n#Person2#: I'm here on holiday and I don't have a local debit card. Is it possible to withdraw money on my Visa credit card here?\n#Person1#: Well, welcome to our country. I trust you are having a pleasant stay?\n#Person2#: Oh, yes. It's amazing here. I don't think I ever want to go home again!\n#Person1#: That's the opinion of most people. Do you have your passport with you? I'll need to see that and you'll need to fill in this withdrawal form.\n#Person2#: Fine. Here you go.\n#Person1#: How much would you like to withdraw?\n#Person2#: Is it OK to withdraw USD?\n#Person1#: That's fine.\n#Person2#: OK, 200 USD, please.\n#Person1#: Here's your money, your card and your passport. Please double check the amount for me.\n#Person2#: Perfect. Thanks!

I have all of your information here. Do you have the cash cheque?\n#Person2#: Here you go.\n#Person1#: I'm sorry Ms. Reeve, it says 45, 000 RMB here.\n#Person2#: Oh, how silly of me. Can we correct it here?\n#Person1#: I'm sorry, we cannot make corrections on these. You'll have to bring another one with the correct amount, I'm afraid.
#Person1#: Excuse me. Could you help me?\n#Person2#: Certainly. What can I do for you?\n#Person1#: I'm looking for a leather belt for my husband.\n#Person2#: Do you know what size he wears?\n#Person1#: Size 36. . . I think.\n#Person2#: And what color would you like?\n#Person1#: Dark brown, if you have it.\n#Person2#: Okay. Let's see. . . a size 36 dark brown leather belt. Oh, yes. Her e we are.

I'll take it.\n#Person2#: Will this be cash or charge?\n#Person1#: Do you take Master Card?\n#Person2#: No, I'm afraid not. We only accept our own store credit card.\n#Person1#: Oh.

#Person1#: Could you give me something for the pain? I couldn't get to sleep until 3 o'clock this morning.\n#Person2#: Aspirin is the strongest medicine I can give you.\n#Person1#: That isn't strong enough, and I don't have to meet my doctor until next week.\n#Person2#: Who is your doctor?\n#Person1#: Dr. Hilary.\n#Person2#: Doesn't he have his office on the corner?\n#Person1#: Yes, he does.\n#Person2#: Are you a regular patient?\n#Person1#: Yes.\n#Person2#: Oh.

It's only 4:30. He should be there until five.
#Person1#: Well, hello everyone, and welcome to today's show. And joining me today is my daughter, Ashley, who has had to endure my cooking experiments over the years. Are we ready, Ashley? [Ready to eat.] No, let's wait for a few minutes. We'll get to that. But as you know, my faithful listeners, I starting cooking and baking almost 30 years ago when my grandmother taught me in her humble kitchen. In fact, she taught almost me everything I know, and I've never attended cooking classes [You should have ...] Wait, wait, wait ... I know my daughter's going to mention to you faithful listeners that recently as I was helping the kids prepare for our kitchen for chicken meal, I forgot to take the chicken out of the oven, burned the bird to a crisp, and we ended up ordering pizza for dinner.\n#Person2#: We had to use the fire extinguisher.\n#Person1#: But that's another story. So, anyway, today I'd like to share with you our favorite ... at least my favorite ... chocolate chip cookie recipe. Now, before you switch the TV channel, I know what you are thinking. 'Another fattening cookie recipe.' But wait. What makes this recipe great is that it offers a wonderful low-fat, low-calorie, low-cholesterol dessert for the entire family.\n#Person2#: We still like the fat though.\n#Person1#: Well, I know we do. But let's see. We have all the ingredients, so we can start by mixing all of the ingredients, the sugars, the flour, the egg whites, the low-fat butter, vanilla, baking soda, and a pinch of salt in a large mixing bowl. Then, we add the mini chocolate chips. Now, my kids would like me to add the big ones but we start with the mini-chocolate chips. And don't forget to preheat the oven to 350 degrees (Fahrenheit). And finally, when the cookies are done, take them out of the oven, remove them from the cookie sheet, and let them cool before their fingers get into them. Did I forget anything?\n#Person2#: Yeah, if you have college-age kids, be sure to make a few extra batches they can take back to school for their roommates. And don't forget the kids still at home.\n#Person1#: Oh, well yeah. We can't do that. We can't forget them. And unfortunately, by the time your kids get the cookies, you, the cook, will be left with a single cookie - your instant diet plan for you - and a dirty kitchen. So, that's all for today. On next week's show, we will be showing you how to feed hungry teenagers on a budget without having to sell the family car. Until then.
#Person1#: Oh, I'm exhausted.\n#Person2#: Why are you so tired? What did you do today?\n#Person1#: There were so many things to do.\n#Person2#: Did you do all those things all yourself?\n#Person1#: Oh, yes. I had to. I had to check the new products. I had to hold the meeting with the department managers. I had to listen to their reports and give my comments. That's my job, you know.\n#Person2#: Well, it sounds like you really had to do all those things. But you shouldn't work too hard. Do you know what you should do at the moment?\n#Person1#: What?\n#Person2#: Take some time off.\n#Person1#: Go on holiday?\n#Person2#: To relax yourself. How about having a trip this weekend?\n#Person1#: And to have a picnic?\n#Person2#: Yes.\n#Person1#: Great!
#Person1#: I'm afraid I must be going now.\n#Person2#: Must you? It's still early.\n#Person1#: I'm afraid I really must. I have to meet a midnight plane.\n#Person2#: In that case, we can't keep you.\n#Person1#: Well, thank you very much for a pleasant evening.\n#Person2#: Thank you for coming. You must come again.\n#Person1#: Thank you. I will. Good-bye.\n#Person2#: Good-bye. I wish you a very good journey home.
#Person1#: I'm really exhausted, Mary. But I don't want to miss the Hollywood movie that comes on at 11.\n#Person2#: If I were you, I'd skip it. We both have to get up early tomorrow. And anyway I've heard it's not as exciting as advertised.
#Person1#: 7286712\n#Person2#: Hello, Susan's speaking, may I speak to Judy please?\n#Person1#: I'm afraid she is not here at the moment. I am her brother, shall I take a massage?\n#Person2#: Yes, you see, Judy and I plan to play table tennis tomorrow, but my cousin has broken my bat, I think Judy has an extra one, so please ask her to bring it for me.\n#Person1#: So, Susan called, her table tennis bat broke, hope Judy bring an extra one.\n#Person2#: Yes, thank you, er.... One more thing, I lent her a book a couple of weeks ago, I think she has probably forgotten it all together, could you possibly ask her to bring along that book as well.\n#Person1#: Ok, bring along Susan's book.\n#Person2#: Thank you very much!\n#Person1#: Bye!
#Person1#: Veronica! Veronica! Veronica! Are you OK? \n#Person2#: Steven! What's going on! Who were those guys? I didn't know you have a gun! What's going on! \n#Person1#: I will come clean as soon as we get to safety, OK? For now, you have to trust me, please! I would never do anything to hurt you. \n#Person2#: Steven, I. . . \n#Person1#: I haven't been completely honest with you Veronica, I'm sorry. I'm not a fireman. I'm not even from the United States. I'm a spy for the Indian government. \n#Person2#: What? Why didn't you tell me before? What are you doing here? \n#Person1#: When I was a young boy, I used to play cricket my father back in my hometown of Hyderabad. It was a peaceful town, and my father was a renowned chemist. One day, he was approached by members of the CIA, claiming that my father had made the discovery of the millennium in his small lab back at the university where he taught bio-chemistry. I never saw him again. I vowed to discover the whereabouts of my father and consequently joined the Indian Intelligence Bureau. \n#Person2#: What does that have to do with those men shooting at us? Most importantly, why did you lie to me! \n#Person1#: I'm sorry, I wasn't supposed to meet you. I wasn't supposed to fall in love with you, but you have to believe me when I tell you that what I feel for you is real. \n#Person2#: I can't believe this! Why are all these things happening to me! I can't take it anymore! Let me out of the car! \n#Person1#: Veronica, wait! 
#Person1#: I was told my friend Joe was speaking ill of me. That's a real let-down. \n#Person2#: I don't think Joe has done such a thing. Don't believe things in haste. \n#Person1#: Maybe I should go and ask him whether it's true. 
#Person1#: Can you help me figure out how to use this vending machine? \n#Person2#: Yes, I would be happy to help. What do you want to buy? \n#Person1#: I want to buy that candy. \n#Person2#: OK. So this machine will make change if you need it. Do you have your dollars ready? \n#Person1#: Yeah, so far, so good. \n#Person2#: Next, you feed your dollars into the machine in the slot. Make sure they are smooth. \n#Person1#: Yeah, I already knew that. \n#Person2#: I'm sure you know that if the dollar gets stuck, you might have to re-feed it. \n#Person1#: OK, let's move on! \n#Person2#: Now you just make your selection and pray. If nothing comes out, try again or call the number on the side of the machine. \n#Person1#: I hope it works! \n#Person2#: Well, good luck! 
#Person1#: I like the Honda Accord you showed me before. I think it's more practical for my needs. \n#Person2#: Alright, sir. You are making a good choice. Honda has made a lot of design improvements in the new Accord. \n#Person1#: What does it come with standard? \n#Person2#: On all our new cars, the standards includeair conditioning, anti-lock brakes, air bags, and an AM/FM stereo with a CD player. But on the Accord, there is another standard item as well. The Accord com \n#Person1#: Cruise control? I don't like that. \n#Person2#: Why not, sir? \n#Person1#: I think it's dangerous. What if I can't turn it off? \n#Person2#: Well, sir, I know some of our customers are concerned about cruise control. But Honda has never had a single cruise control malfunction that led to an accident. \n#Person1#: I wish it didn't have cruise control. My wife doesn't like it either. \n#Person2#: You know, sir, you don't have to use it. You can turn it on or off. If you don't want to use it, you just never turn it on. \n#Person1#: I suppose. And what about the sunroof? Is that standard? \n#Person2#: No, the sunroof is optional, sir. \n#Person1#: I see. Another important question is the time I can get this car. I need a new car rather soon. \n#Person2#: Well, I can say that the new models will be here in August. If you order one now, we will have it for you in August. \n#Person1#: That's good enough, I think. What colors does the new Accord come in? \n#Person2#: We have this new model in red, white, black, or silver. These are the standard colors. Of course you could specially order from various other colors too. \n#Person1#: My brother has last year's Accord. And his car is a kind of soft purple color mixed with silver. I really like that color. I wonder if I can get that color on my Accord. \n#Person2#: I know the color you mean. Is this it, sir? \n#Person1#: Yes, I think that's it. Can I get that on the Accord? \n#Person2#: Yes, you can. That color is very popular with Honda buyers. So we've kept it available. \n#Person1#: Well, I think I want to order the new Accord then. It looks like an excellent car. \n#Person2#: You have made a good choice, sir. I drive an Accord myself. They are very solidly built machines, very reliable. \n#Person1#: Yes, I know. I think Honda is the most reliable car on the road. I would never change to anything else. The Honda I have now almost never has service problems. It runs smooth as silk. \n#Person2#: Alright, sir. I will get the paperwork ready for you. Just a moment. 
#Person1#: I met a girl in elevator this morning. She works in a company upstairs. She said she envied the casual way we dress for work. She complained about the dress rule in her company. It requires everyone to wear formal clothes from Monday to Friday. \n#Person2#: Well, I was wondering where those people with professional attire come from. Now, I know the answer. \n#Person1#: You know, in a sense, a suits and ties are compulsory for male employees even in July, and no jewelry allowed for most of the female employees. Even the reasonable male leaf is returning the rule, isn't that strict? \n#Person2#: To some extent, it is. Anyway, whether they like it or not, they do give people a very good impression. \n#Person1#: But it is unjust to judge a book by its cover. If they're not happy or comfortable with their clothes, they can be less productive. 
#Person1#: Do you like cooking? \n#Person2#: Yes , I do it a lot. but I don't like doing dishes. what about you, do you like cooking and then cleaning up afterwards? \n#Person1#: To be honest, I don't really like doing either one , I can't cook and I hate cleaning. \n#Person2#: Suppose you have to do one of the two, which do you prefer? \n#Person1#: I would rather do the dishes than cook. \n#Person2#: I prefer the absent. the way I see it , to do the dishes is boring. \n#Person1#: let's make a deal. \n#Person2#: What? \n#Person1#: I'm going to buy some vegetable and you cook. \n#Person2#: Will you do the dishes after the meal? \n#Person1#: Fair enough! 
#Person1#: Would you like to drink some coffee? \n#Person2#: No, thanks. I have some trouble with my heart, my doctor recommend I to drink less. \n#Person1#: Would you like to try some watermelon juice? It tastes good. \n#Person2#: All right 
#Person1#: Morning, Mary. I haven't seen you in a long time. What's up? \n#Person2#: Oh, I took up a new hobby. \n#Person1#: So you don't travel a lot now? \n#Person2#: No, Frank. I'm much more interestcd in collecting stamps now. \n#Person1#: It's certainly a popular hobby. I know a lot of people love stamps. \n#Person2#: It certainly is. It's so much fun. \n#Person1#: I believe collecting stamps has something similar to traveling right? \n#Person2#: Absolutely. Through all kinds of stamps I am able to learn about the world. \n#Person1#: Well, every stamp has a story to tell. \n#Person2#: You're right. And I also meet many new friends while collecting stamps. \n#Person1#: Good. \n#Person2#: Sometimes we even spend hours discussing our collcctions. \n#Person1#: There's a lot to share when you have a common interest. \n#Person2#: Yes, it's really amazing. I got to go now. I'm meeting with some other collectors. \n#Person1#: Ok, good luck. See you \n#Person2#: See you, Frank. 
#Person1#: Bruce, I think it's time to go and meet Pam at the airport.\n#Person2#: Oh no, we have no need to hurry. There's plenty of time. It's only 8:30. There won't be much traffic at this time of night.\n#Person1#: You never know. And I think your watch must be slow. I make it 8:40 and you'll have to stop for gas. I'd rather get there too early than too late.\n#Person2#: It'll take her a while to get her luggage.\n#Person1#: Oh, come on, Bruce. It's time to leave. We can always have coffee at the airport. Anyway, I like watching people at the airport.\n#Person2#: I'd rather see the end of the football match, but never mind. We better go.
#Person1#: Which season do you like the most?\n#Person2#: I like summer the most. But at the same time I hate it. I like summer because it's warm. I don't mind the heat and I like the longer days so I can do more activities like swimming, bicycling and many other outdoor activities. I usually take a short vacation during the summer so I always look forward to that. However, the part about summer I hate the most is during the rainy season. When it gets hot along with the rain and the wind, it gets terrible.
#Person1#: I think my purse was stolen sir.\n#Person2#: Do you have any reason to believe that your purse was stolen?\n#Person1#: Oh yes, I left it on the table 20 minutes ago and then I went to the restroom. But when I came back 15 minutes ago it was gone.\n#Person2#: Are you sure you left your purse on the table?\n#Person1#: Of course sir, I plan to pay the bill before I went to the restroom.\n#Person2#: Is this your purse? We found it in the restroom.\n#Person1#: Oh, yes it is. I must have left it there and I totally forgot. Sorry.
#Person1#: My boss told me never to go to work again.\n#Person2#: Why?\n#Person1#: I don't know. When he told me that, I was very sad and surprised.\n#Person2#: Do you often go to work late?\n#Person1#: Yes, I often do.\n#Person2#: Do you work hard?\n#Person1#: Well, it's hard to say. It depends.\n#Person2#: Are you good at the computer?\n#Person1#: No, I don't know how to use it.\n#Person2#: Then I know the reason. You didn't use your time well and you don't learn new things.
#Person1#: Hello, Mike, it's Carrie in here. I've just been reading a paper and I find a job advertised on it will be perfect for you.\n#Person2#: Oh, what's the job?\n#Person1#: They want a marketing manager. Isn't that the kind of thing you're looking for?\n#Person2#: Yes. Does it say what the job involves?\n#Person1#: The main thing seems to be that you'll be in charge of sales planning.\n#Person2#: Well, what sort of people are they looking for? I suppose they want me to have an MBA.\n#Person1#: There's nothing about that. But it does say that they're looking for someone who can speak foreign languages. Well, that's OK for you, because you've lived abroad and you can speak German, don't you?\n#Person2#: Yes, and Spanish, too. When do the applications have to be completed?\n#Person1#: The third of July is the closing date. So you have exactly a month to complete. Do you want me to email you the advert, so you can see it yourself?\n#Person2#: Yes, that'll be great.\n#Person1#: OK, I'll do that now.
#Person1#: Can you believe that I've been here almost a whole term, and you're the only friend I've made?\n#Person2#: No, how can that be?\n#Person1#: I don't know, you know me better than anyone else here at school. I thought maybe you could give me some advice.\n#Person2#: Sure, um, do you belong to any clubs or organizations? That's the best way to meet people.\n#Person1#: No, I don't have a lot of time to go to meetings.\n#Person2#: Neither do I, but, I do play school sports. It's just a group that meets regularly to play basketball. Of course, there are lots of other teams. You could join a football team or baseball, volleyball. Just go over to the Sports Center and sign up.\n#Person1#: I'd like to do that, but I don't want to take time away from my studies.\n#Person2#: Well, then why don't you join a study group? That way you won't feel like you're wasting time and besides, the people you meet will be serious students, so maybe they would be better friends for you anyway.\n#Person1#: This sounds good.
#Person1#: Excuse me sir, I'm a stranger here and have lost my way.\n#Person2#: Where do you want to go?\n#Person1#: I want to return to my hotel, the New York Hotel.\n#Person2#: Go straight along this road, then go over the bridge and turn right at the book shop. You'll find your hotel.\n#Person1#: Thank you, by the way, can you direct me to the Central Park?\n#Person2#: Oh, it's so far from here, you can take the subway.\n#Person1#: How long will it take me if I walk there?\n#Person2#: It might take you 3/4 of an hour.\n#Person1#: Well, where is the subway station?\n#Person2#: You just turn left, and walk 3 blocks and you'll find it.\n#Person1#: Where should I get off?\n#Person2#: Get off at forty fifth street.
#Person1#: How do you eat sushi, Mister Nakamura?\n#Person2#: I usually use chopsticks but some people prefer just using hands.\n#Person1#: You can eat with your hands at the restaurant?\n#Person2#: Yeah, it's totally acceptable in the traditional sushi restaurant.\n#Person1#: Hmm, interesting. So do I just eat it straight?\n#Person2#: Well, I like to eat it straight and enjoy the natural flavor of the fish, but you can always go with wasabi.\n#Person1#: Wasabi? What's wasabi?\n#Person2#: Wasabi is a sauce, which gives sushi a spicy flavor.\n#Person1#: Oh, you mean the green stuff, which always makes my tears come out?\n#Person2#: Correct. Some restaurants actually give you wasabi along with your sushi dish so that you can control the hotness.\n#Person1#: That's considerate. You've really taught me so much about Japanese culture. Thank you, Mister Nakamura.\n#Person2#: Don't mention it. We should help each other since we work in the same company now.
#Person1#: Cambridge Theatre box office.\n#Person2#: Have you got any tickets left for Romeo and Juliet for this Saturday.\n#Person1#: Which performance? 5:00 PM or 8:30 PM?\n#Person2#: 8:30 PM, please.\n#Person1#: We have tickets at 5 pounds, 6 pounds and 8 pounds.\n#Person2#: I'd like to reserve 2 seats at 6 pounds each, please.\n#Person1#: Alright, that's two tickets at 6 pounds, Saturday, 8:30 PM performance.

How are you going to contact him?\n#Person1#: I'm leaving him a message taped to my computer screen.\n#Person2#: What does it say? Do you think he'll see it?\n#Person1#: He'll see it. It says, I like sweets. Meet me at two thirty in the parking lot.\n#Person2#: Can I spy on you guys from the window?\n#Person1#: No. But I'll fill you in later. Right now I have to find Vince.
#Person1#: Excuse me, could you help me pick out a lotion?\n#Person2#: Sure, what is the problem?\n#Person1#: I got poison oak while hiking, and I need something to help me with the itching.\n#Person2#: I can suggest a product called Techne that comes in a lotion or cream.\n#Person1#: Which do you prefer?\n#Person2#: Hikers tell me that the cream is best because it stays on longer.\n#Person1#: Is there anything else I can do to help with the itching?\n#Person2#: You can take an antihistamine.\n#Person1#: Thank you so much for all of the information.\n#Person2#: You are welcome. Please feel free to ask me a question any time you need help.

#Person1#: Joe, how are you doing?\n#Person2#: I am great! How about you, Mary? How are you?\n#Person1#: I am doing great! Thank you for asking, Joe.\n#Person2#: I was wondering if you want to go see a movie with me tonight?\n#Person1#: I need to stay home tonight and finish my term paper.\n#Person2#: OK. What about going to the movies on Friday night?\n#Person1#: What were you planning on seeing?\n#Person2#: I was thinking about seeing that one about the rapist serial killer.\n#Person1#: How about ' The Secret Life of Bees '?\n#Person2#: That's a chick flick!
#Person1#: How silly of you to jump out of the window!\n#Person2#: But that was the first thing that came into my mind when I heard the shout earthquake!\n#Person1#: Why not use staircases? The terror was not so violent at that time.\n#Person2#: That would be too late.\n#Person1#: Maybe the situation is too urgent.\n#Person2#: Yes, I think I should have jumped in any case.
#Person1#: What's the problem, Nada? You look down in the dumps.\n#Person2#: I don't know. My life is a big mess. Everything is so complicated.\n#Person1#: come on, nothing can be that bad.\n#Person2#: but promise me, you'll keep it a secret.\n#Person1#: ok, I promise. So what's troubling you so much?\n#Person2#: I've fallen in love with my boss.\n#Person1#: really? Is he married?\n#Person2#: no, of course not. He is still single.\n#Person1#: then what's your problem?\n#Person2#: I try to keep it to myself. But there is a lot of gossip about us.\n#Person1#: oh, I see. Office romance tends to be the subject of gossip.\n#Person2#: worse still, he is trying to avoid me these days.\n#Person1#: office romance is very tricky.\n#Person2#: it gives me a lot of pressure and I feel depressed.\n#Person1#: cheer up, Nada. You'll be fine.
#Person1#: Oh, I am not sure I even want to look at this house!\n#Person2#: It is a bit of a fixer-upper. Let's take a look inside.\n#Person1#: It doesn't look much better inside this place.\n#Person2#: You know, with a little elbow grease and paint, you could spruce it up a bit.\n#Person1#: There are hardly any windows in here, and that makes it really gloomy.\n#Person2#: Let's go check out the kitchen. The printout says that it is quite large.\n#Person1#: Look at those broken tile countertops and the peeling wallpaper.\n#Person2#: Maybe the master suite has some redeeming qualities. Follow me, please.\n#Person1#: What's that smell?\n#Person2#: Perhaps we should move on to the next listing.
#Person1#: You're home late today, David. How was school?\n#Person2#: Not bad. There's a new English teacher.\n#Person1#: Oh, what's she like?\n#Person2#: She is beautiful.\n#Person1#: Is she old or young?\n#Person2#: She is quite young and her hair is blond.\n#Person1#: Is she strict?\n#Person2#: Not really. Her eyes are blue.\n#Person1#: Can she speak Chinese?\n#Person2#: Not much. She is very tall and slim.\n#Person1#: David, stop dreaming. It's time to do your homework.
#Person1#: We can't wait any longer. . .\n#Person2#: I'm terribly sorry to be so late. I had an article. . .\n#Person1#: You'll knock yourself out the way you've worked. Why don't you slow down?\n#Person2#: I can't afford to.\n#Person1#: All right. Now that everybody's here. Shall we be getting started? Miss Lin, are you ready?\n#Person2#: Yes, thanks. Before I start, I'd like to thank Professor Smith for all his help in giving me unlimited access to his research materials.\n#Person1#: Excuse me, Miss Lin. Would you mind speaking up, please? I can't hear you very well.\n#Person2#: Sorry, I'll try to speak louder.
#Person1#: What kind of note are you taking there. That looks like doodle to me.\n#Person2#: It's picture association of the concept that the professor taught today.\n#Person1#: Does that actually work for you?\n#Person2#: I don't really know for sure yet. I'll tell you after the test on Friday.\n#Person1#: I like to use shorthand note taking.\n#Person2#: I was told once that the more time you spend writing, the less you are paying attention and so you miss stuff.\n#Person1#: Hmm. I never thought about it that way.\n#Person2#: One time I tried just listening, no notes, no pictures. I think I really learned more that day.
#Person1#: David, what do you want to do after graduation?\n#Person2#: I suppose I should choose one from the'Best Career List', to be a public officer, what do you think?\n#Person1#: That sounds like a hot job, right? But in my opinion, you ought not to choose one career from that so-called list, and you need to take your interests, values, and skills into account.\n#Person2#: It beats me! I never thought about it before and maybe I thought finding a career is a simple thing.\n#Person1#: You'd better ask for suggestions from a career counselor, and then make a decision.
#Person1#: Is that your phone?\n#Person2#: yes, it's my new business phone. Do you like it?\n#Person1#: it's very impressive. Can you use the Internet on your phone?\n#Person2#: yes, it's got wireless Internet access.\n#Person1#: that's really convenient. Does it have the Bluetooth?\n#Person2#: yes, but I don't really use it that often. Have you ever used it?\n#Person1#: no, but I think it'd be really great for people like you who are always on the go.\n#Person2#: yes, I guess I should try to use it.\n#Person1#: does it have a camera?\n#Person2#: of course it does. Doesn't every new phone include a camera these days?\n#Person1#: I guess so. Would you mind if I checked my email quickly? I'm supposed to be getting an important email this evening from a client.\n#Person2#: sure. Here you go.\n#Person1#: have you checked your voicemail recently?\n#Person2#: no, why?\n#Person1#: I think this icon means that you have a voicemail message.\n#Person2#: oh, yeah. Probably. I don't really know how to use this phone yet.\n#Person1#: do you want to listen to your messages first?\n#Person2#: no, it's ok. Check your email first ; I'll check my unbox later.\n#Person1#: I'm surprised you don't use more of the features on your phone.\n#Person2#: I'm surprised you know so much about it. Where's your phone?\n#Person1#: it quit working last week and I haven't had a chance to buy a new one yet.\n#Person2#: how have you been living without a cell phone for a week? hasn't it been driving you carry being without a phone?\n#Person1#: it's not that bad. It kind of feels like I'm on vacation, not having to answer my phone all the time!\n#Person2#: let's go shopping. You can't depend on public phones in this day and age!
#Person1#: What are you doing to your house?\n#Person2#: We're redecorating our living room.\n#Person1#: What are you going to do to it?\n#Person2#: First, we're going to change the curtains, then we're going to paint the walls.\n#Person1#: What colour are you going to paint them?\n#Person2#: Pale yellow.\n#Person1#: What else are you going to do?\n#Person2#: We're going to put in some new furniture.
#Person1#: Excuse me, which one is of the highest quality here?\n#Person2#: This one. It is of the best quality and excellently tailored as well. You may try it on.\n#Person1#: That is nice. But I don't quite like the collar.\n#Person2#: The collar? It is just the collar that is popular with young people in Shanghai.\n#Person1#: I don't care what others wear. How much is it?\n#Person2#: 250 Yuan.\n#Person1#: Really? Too expensive. I don't think I can afford it.\n#Person2#: But it is really worthwhile.\n#Person1#: OK, anyway, let me have it.\n#Person2#: Here you are.\n#Person1#: Thank you.
#Person1#: Hi! Someone has reported a fault on one of your copiers.\n#Person2#: That's right. I'm glad you're here. It hasn't been working properly for the last few days.\n#Person1#: When was it serviced?\n#Person2#: Just a couple of weeks ago. It's usually very reliable.\n#Person1#: What's actually wrong with it?\n#Person2#: Well, it's making a strange noise when we try to change paper trays.\n#Person1#: I'm sure it's nothing serious, probably just a minor fault. I'll have a look at it.
#Person1#: I'm quite upset! I want a new room and a refund for tonight.\n#Person2#: Forgive me, sir, I haven't been told what the problem is.\n#Person1#: I'm about to be swept away by millions of cockroaches!\n#Person2#: My apologies, sir. We'll transfer you to a new room at once and give you a full refund.\n#Person1#: Thank you. I didn't want to have to take this to court.\n#Person2#: Sir, we never want a guest to stay here mad or unhappy.
#Person1#: Did you even bother to go to school today?\n#Person2#: Yeah, I went. Did you go?\n#Person1#: No, I didn't feel like it.\n#Person2#: That's nice, have you been to the movies lately?\n#Person1#: No, but that was a random change of subject.\n#Person2#: It may have been random, but have you?\n#Person1#: I haven't lately.\n#Person2#: I would love to catch a movie this weekend.\n#Person1#: So then, why don't you just go?\n#Person2#: I don't want to see a movie by myself.\n#Person1#: Okay, so are you going to school tomorrow?\n#Person2#: I think I might just go to the movies.
#Person1#: Can your dog do any tricks?\n#Person2#: Sure he can. He can shake hands, roll over, and even play dead.\n#Person1#: I wish I had a dog. My cat can't do any tricks.\n#Person2#: Yeah, but sometimes Bingo wants to play with me, but I don't have time.\n#Person1#: So who takes care of him then?\n#Person2#: My little brother likes to play with him. He even gives him a bath every week.\n#Person1#: I can't do that with my cat. She hates water.\n#Person2#: You know, you're right. Maybe you should get a dog.
#Person1#: are you ready for the meeting?\n#Person2#: yes, come on in. how's your new job going?\n#Person1#: it's challenging, but I'm enjoying it quite a bit.\n#Person2#: that's great. I knew you'd do a good job as a manager.\n#Person1#: thanks a lot.\n#Person2#: how's your assistant manager getting on?\n#Person1#: well, that's part of the problem. His probation period is up tomorrow and I don't think he's ready to pass.\n#Person2#: what seems to be the problem?\n#Person1#: well, he was supposed to be able to learn his job in 30 days, but he just doesn't seem to know what he's doing.\n#Person2#: if you gave him another 30 days, do you think he could figure it out by then?\n#Person1#: to be honest, he has no authority. He's a hard-worker, but no one listens to him.\n#Person2#: I see. Not everyone is cut out to work in management.\n#Person1#: I know. It'd be great if we could transfer him to a department where he doesn't have to work with people.\n#Person2#: there's an opening in the creative design department. It involves working with computers.\n#Person1#: that's perfect. I'll let him know tomorrow. Thanks!
#Person1#: Mon and I got in another fight, Boris.\n#Person2#: oh, Iris! what was it about this time?\n#Person1#: it was over food. I simply wanted some fried chicken but she said no.\n#Person2#: I believe she was right. You must know that fried foods contain a lot of fat.\n#Person1#: oh, she keeps saying that. She never allows me to have them.\n#Person2#: I think you'd better take her advice since health is the greatest wealth.\n#Person1#: But, Boris, i am not a baby any more.\n#Person2#: well, that's true.\n#Person1#: how about your mother?\n#Person2#: she also believes in healthy diet. And she requires us to have regular meals.\n#Person1#: poor you. It seems we are in the same boat.\n#Person2#: Oh, i am grateful for my mother on this point. her idea of healthy eating helps me a lot keeping fit.\n#Person1#: really? so you don't have fried food at all.\n#Person2#: not really. I may have some occasionally for a chance. But I don't indulge myself too much.\n#Person1#: how do you manage it?\n#Person2#: it's pretty simple, Iris. Just keep it in mind that you're what you eat.
#Person1#: that was a great party. Thanks for saying behind to help me clear up.\n#Person2#: it certainly was a great party. It's a pity that a glass and a plate got broken and someone spilled a drink over here.\n#Person1#: I expected that something might get broken. That doesn't bother me. That spilled drink won't leave a stain, will it?\n#Person2#: I doubt it, I ' ll deal with it right away. Luckily it wasn't a glass of red wine, I'll just get a bowl of water and a cloth.\n#Person1#: I'm going to put all the rubbish into this big plastic bag.\n#Person2#: afterwards, we can do the washing up together. Everything will be finished within an hour. Your friend Keith is really funny. I liked his magic tricks.\n#Person1#: yes, he's very good. . isn't he? He told some funny stories too.\n#Person2#: Amanda told some very funny jokes. At the beginning of the party, she was being ver serious.\n#Person1#: I think that she had a litter too much of the punch.\n#Person2#: what did you put in that punch? It tasted great, but was quite strong.\n#Person1#: that's my little secret. Did you like the snacks and I prepared?\n#Person2#: very much. The birthday cake was delicious, wasn't it? Emily told me that she and karen made it themselves.\n#Person1#: that cake tasted so good! It disappeared within minutes, so I think everyone liked it a lot. How's that stain?\n#Person2#: all cleaned up. Are you ready to start on the washing up.
#Person1#: I'm sorry, sir. I'm going to have to ask you to leave.\n#Person2#: What? I was just having a friendly conversation with the lady here. . .\n#Person1#: Well, she apparently doesn't think it's so friendly. Let's go.\n#Person2#: I think there's been a misunderstanding!\n#Person1#: You'd better cooperate with me, sir, or. . .\n#Person2#: OK! Just give her this for me!
#Person1#: What do you think we need to do to get our new branch office running well?\n#Person2#: First, I'd make sure that we have a good, local, corporate lawyer. He or she will know all the local laws and regulations.\n#Person1#: That's very important. A friend recommended a good law firm to me. We'll need someone to hire staff.\n#Person2#: I think that we should send one of our HR people to do that. I don't think we should use an agency, because they won't be familiar with the type of people we employ. Have we decide on the location of the branch office?\n#Person1#: Yes. We have. We chose the location in the northeast of the city, not too far from the airport and on the edge of the CBD.\n#Person2#: Why didn't we choose an office in the CBD?\n#Person1#: The offices there were too expensive. Have we negotiated any contracts yet?\n#Person2#: Yes. We'Ve signed two contracts with companies that we already do work for in other countries. We hope to sign another three this month.\n#Person1#: When will the branch office open?\n#Person2#: Hopefully next month. Everything is a little rushed. We should be able to set up our branch office and expand our business quickly.\n#Person1#: Has and advertising campaign been prepared?\n#Person2#: Yes, it has. We're going to target the business community through business magazine.\n#Person1#: I made plenty of business contract on my last visit and through the embassy. We should be able to get plenty of customers.
#Person1#: Hi, have you got the exact number of people who are going take part in this activity?\n#Person2#: Yes, there are 62 in totals, and 2 of them still can't be sure.\n#Person1#: They always push the time. How many of them are over fifty?\n#Person2#: 6. So we should give them special attention. Some of them don't have a good health.\n#Person1#: OK, I see. As far as you think, how many buses should we get for them?\n#Person2#: 2 should be enough, for each one has at least 30 seats. There will be some seats to spare.\n#Person1#: I'll call the bus charter later. And have you announced the itinerary of this journey to all of them?\n#Person2#: Yes, most of them think it's good. But, some people have different opinions. They consider we should arrange some challenging activities.\n#Person1#: That's possible. At that time, they can choose any activity they like.\n#Person2#: That's good. I'll tell them later. And what kind of medicine we should be prepared?\n#Person1#: Let me think! Pills for carsick, traditional medicine for cold, some painkillers and something like that.\n#Person2#: OK, we should get them ready this afternoon.\n#Person1#: One more thing, have you got all people's phone numbers?\n#Person2#: Oh, God. I've almost forgotten. I'll get it done right away.
#Person1#: The government is going to organize a folk-custom activity at the end of the month. And our community is supposed to put on a performance.\n#Person2#: What kind of performance? A lion dance?\n#Person1#: Stuff like that but I think the lion dance is a bit too difficult and dangerous.\n#Person2#: Sure, you'll be dancing with lions. What do you expect? Then what about Range Dance which we did before.\n#Person1#: Good idea. Shall we get everyone in the community?\n#Person2#: Maybe not. I think we should just focus on the retired people.\n#Person1#: I know that they already have a Range Dance team and then what we need is just to do some rehearsals.\n#Person2#: What about the costumes?\n#Person1#: We can raise money in the community. You know each family 10 yuan maybe.\n#Person2#: Try something new. We can find a supporting agency.\n#Person1#: Great idea. There is a travel agency nearby who would love to be our sponsor. It's a perfect chance for them to promote ethnic tourism.
#Person1#: Do you have any plan to buy a house in this city?\n#Person2#: Absolutely we need a house here. But what makes me upset is the prices in this city.\n#Person1#: Our monthly salary can not buy one square meter of the house here.\n#Person2#: It is depressing to hear the price goes higher and higher.\n#Person1#: More and more people need to buy houses, but the market can not meet the needs, so this caused the bubble in real estate industry.\n#Person2#: And the rich still wants to buy more, even though they have at least one house to live.\n#Person1#: Have you watched the TV series, Humble Abode?\n#Person2#: Yes, it displays some social problems and interprets the values of our white-collars.\n#Person1#: I really, really want a house, even though it is small like a snail house.
#Person1#: What did her boss say to you?\n#Person2#: He asked me to beef up in the work.\n#Person1#: Yeah. You look so unhappy recently. What's the matter.\n#Person2#: Nothing, thanks. I am just not in the mood these days.
#Person1#: I will take the coat. Do you receive checks?\n#Person2#: Yes, of course.\n#Person1#: Here you are. Please give me a receipt.\n#Person2#: Sorry, sir, you have to pay in the check-out counter. It's there.\n#Person1#: OK, please wrap it for me first.
#Person1#: Would you like to order now?\n#Person2#: This all looks good! I think we know what we want.\n#Person1#: Please let me point out the chef's special, which is blackened catfish.\n#Person2#: I am dieting, so could the chef prepare the food with no extra sauce?\n#Person1#: We are always happy to adjust our cooking to meet your needs.\n#Person2#: Could you tell me if there are any entrees that are vegetarian?\n#Person1#: The cashew broccoli noodles or the cheese and veggie enchiladas would be an excellent choice.\n#Person2#: I am going to go with the grilled shrimp with garlic sauce. I would like the garlic sauce on the side.\n#Person1#: Would you like your salad brought to you with your entree, or would you like it served now?\n#Person2#: You can serve our salads with our dinner.
#Person1#: I came in to see how my home inspection went.\n#Person2#: First of all, I need to share what the purpose of a home inspection is. Do you understand what I was doing there?\n#Person1#: I had a home inspection before, but didn't really understand it.\n#Person2#: I help you spot potential problems with the home before you purchase it.\n#Person1#: The owner said that the roof had leaked, but that he got it fixed last month.\n#Person2#: Sellers aren't really all that objective. They may have gotten used to a leaky faucet, but it is still broken.\n#Person1#: Are the sellers responsible for fixing the problems with the house?\n#Person2#: The owners may wish to pay to have the problems fixed, or maybe the price of the house can be reduced.\n#Person1#: Did you find a lot of things wrong during the home inspection?\n#Person2#: The house has a very outdated electrical system. Many of the switches and outlets do not work and are unsafe.
#Person1#: Hello? Ms. Patterson? This is Bill from Workmate calling. I'm just wondering if you had a chance to look over the estimate I sent for your gala dinner project next month. . . As I said in my email, we can help you with production according to your needs, but we will only be able to give insite management support services on a limited basis.\n#Person2#: Oh, yes. I reviewed your estimate. But it seems like the project blueprint you sent with the estimate is not quite what we had in mind. Did you get a copy of the specs for this project?\n#Person1#: Yes, I have several copies, but they're all different versions. . . The latest I have is version 12, is that current?\n#Person2#: No. Later we decided to opt for the prior outline, version 7.\n#Person1#: Hold on, let me pull up your version 7 requirements. . . Oh yes, no wonder our estimate is a little different from what you had in mind. I see the version 7 also includes 6 additional hostesses and a cocktail self-serve bar that wasn't in the version 12. That will definitely add to your cost on this project. . .
#Person1#: OK, so are you ready to learn how to bake a cake?\n#Person2#: Almost, let me just put my apron on.\n#Person1#: OK, so the first thing we are going to do is pre-heat the oven, that way we have it at the desired temperature once we finish preparing everything. Set it to three hundred and seventy five degrees Fahrenheit.\n#Person2#: Got it.\n#Person1#: No we are gonna make the batter. Take some butter and sugar and mix it lightly until you have a nice consistency. Then add some vanilla extract and eggs and continue mixing.\n#Person2#: Do I have to use a whisk or can I use the electric mixer?\n#Person1#: Go ahead and use the mixer, but put it on medium speed. I'm gonna sift the flour and baking powder separately and then we can mix it with milk and the rest of the ingredients.\n#Person2#: OK, so now we need a baking pan right?\n#Person1#: Yeah, but grease and flour it first so the cake won't stick to it when it bakes.\n#Person2#: Done. So how long do we bake it for?\n#Person1#: We can leave it in there for about twenty five minutes. Then we let it cool for ten minutes before we remove the cake from the pan.\n#Person2#: Wow! This was a lot easier than I thought!
#Person1#: Hello, Room Reservation Service. May I help you?\n#Person2#: Yes. This is Mrs. Davinson. I'd like to reserve a two-room suite for tonight.\n#Person1#: Let me see. Yeah, There are two such rooms left. May I have your name please?\n#Person2#: Mrs. Davinson. Mary Davison. M-A-R-Y, mary. D-A-V-I-N-S-O-N. Davison.\n#Person1#: OK. I've got it.\n#Person2#: Thank you. Good-bye.\n#Person1#: Good-bye.
#Person1#: Frank, we've got a problem. We don't have enough money to pay the rent this month. I think I'd better ask Mon and Dad for a loan, or ask my boss for a raise.\n#Person2#: Well, I don't know. But maybe I'd better not take another English course this semester.
#Person1#: What was it like working with those young stars?\n#Person2#: It was a great group, I always got mad when people said that we didn't get along, just because we're girls, there was never a fight. We had a great time.
#Person1#: I'm fed up with sitting on packing cases, Joe. Don't you think we should buy at least two chairs?\n#Person2#: Do you know how much new chairs cost? One cheap comfortable armchair is eighty pounds.\n#Person1#: Yes, I know. It's terrible. But I have an idea. Why don't we look for chairs at a street market? I've always wanted to see one.\n#Person2#: All right. Which one shall we go to?\n#Person1#: Portobello Road, I think. There are a lot of secondhand things there. And we'll have to go tomorrow. It's only open on Saturdays.\n#Person2#: What time do you want to go? Not too early. I hope.\n#Person1#: The guidebook says the market is open from nine to six. It's a very popular market, so we'd better be there when it opens.\n#Person2#: Right. I'll set the alarm.
#Person1#: We were advised to have a holiday by the lake. What's your opinion?\n#Person2#: I suggest we go to the seashore. I love it there.\n#Person1#: But it is too far away. How about going to the mountains?\n#Person2#: That's a good idea.
#Person1#: Hello, everyone. Welcome to our program. Today, we are fortunate to have a special guest with us. Some of you may have heard of him before. He's an artist. His works have received many prizes and have been shown in over one hundred exhibitions across the country - Los Angeles, New York, Philadelphia, to name just a few. His name is Chris Cucksy. So Chris, tell us a bit about yourself.\n#Person2#: Well, I was born in Springfield, Missouri, and grew up in Kansas. I didn't come from a family with wealth or position, but I did manage to get a master's degree in fine arts.\n#Person1#: When did you first start to make art? And what was the turning point in your life that made you an artist?\n#Person2#: I always liked drawing as early as I can remember, so right from then, I knew what I was going to be: an artist.\n#Person1#: What is it that always inspires you to create?\n#Person2#: Nature is the biggest inspiration. I'm always inspired by things of beauty and harmony.
#Person1#: Oh, Mrs. Smith. Can I take the test now? I just ..., oh.\n#Person2#: Excuse me? What do you mean? The test ended 10 minutes ago, and you weren't there to take it. Sorry.\n#Person1#: Oh, Mrs. Smith. Come on. Come on. That's not fair.\n#Person2#: What do you mean it's not fair. Everyone else was there. So, why weren't you in class?\n#Person1#: Uh, my bus didn't come this morning on time. That's why.\n#Person2#: Um. Are you sure? Your friend, Tony, made it to class, and he said you were still in bed an hour ago.\n#Person1#: Uhh, yeah, well, that might be true, but I really need to take the test.\n#Person2#: Wait. Don't you realize that you just lied to me?\n#Person1#: Uh, well, listen. Mrs. Smith. Listen. My alarm didn't go off this morning, so it's not my fault I came late.\n#Person2#: So, you're blaming your alarm clock again? It's still your responsibility to be here. Wasn't that your excuse the last two times you missed class?\n#Person1#: But Mrs. Smith, Mrs. Smith.\n#Person2#: Listen. You know the policy of our program. If you miss a test for an unexcused reason ... and a lie is definitely unexcused, then you get a zero on the test. There are no exceptions.\n#Person1#: Mrs. Smith. Why don't you want to help me? You never help me. I mean I really need to pass this class.\n#Person2#: No, no. no. Listen to yourself. You're playing what we call the victim. You made some bad choices, and now you have to accept the consequences. Remember: When you point your finger at someone else, like me in this case, three fingers are pointing back at you.\n#Person1#: But Mrs. Smith. I lose my scholarship if I do poorly in the class; my parents will be really disappointed in me.\n#Person2#: I'm really sorry, but that's not my problem. [Oh, Mrs. Smith!] I can't help you with that. Don't try to shift the blame here. [Mrs. Smith!] You painted yourself into a corner. You need to be accountable for your own actions instead of trying to weasel out of your responsibility. While you aren't doing well in my class though, I must say I almost have to give you an A grade for trying to dodge the outcome of your bad choices.\n#Person1#: Mrs. Smith, Mrs. Smith.\n#Person2#: Listen. You are learning one thing.\n#Person1#: What?\n#Person2#: My name.\n#Person1#: Agh.
#Person1#: Why do we have to walk to the station? And where is it?\n#Person2#: It's just down that road...I think.\n#Person1#: Look! There's a policeman! Ask him the way.\n#Person2#: All right. I'll go and ask him.\n#Person1#: (pause for 6 seconds) So,what did he say?\n#Person2#: Well, we have to walk down this road, take the first turning on the left. Then walk until we come to the river and...\n#Person1#: The river?\n#Person2#: Yes. It's over there, and there's a bridge. Across the bridge, we will be able to see some road signs which will tell us the way.\n#Person1#: But how far is it? How long does it take to walk there?\n#Person2#: About fifteen minutes, if we walk quickly.\n#Person1#: Fifteen minutes! We may be late for the train. And with these heavy bags, too! I think we ought to take a taxi.\n#Person2#: Not at this hour. Look at the traffic. It's moving very slowly. We can get there just as quickly on foot.\n#Person1#: Well, I can't possibly carry this bag any farther.\n#Person2#: All right. Let me take it, then.\n#Person1#: Don't be silly. You can't carry two bags at the same time.\n#Person2#: Yes, I can. The bags aren't that heavy...hmm!\n#Person1#: You see! They're heavier than you thought!\n#Person2#: Perhaps it's not such a bad idea after all.\n#Person1#: What isn't such a bad idea? What do you mean?\n#Person2#: Taxi! Taxi!
#Person1#: Well, this must be the National Library.\n#Person2#: I guess so. Oh, no! I don't think it's open today. Look, it says 'Closed Tuesdays'.\n#Person1#: Well, we'll just have to come back tomorrow.\n#Person2#: But we're supposed to go on that tour tomorrow.\n#Person1#: Oh, that's right. I forgot all about it. How about the day after tomorrow then?\n#Person2#: It's Ok with me.
#Person1#: Now, Cathy, do we know when the visitors from India are coming?\n#Person2#: We offered them 3 choices, the end of March, the middle of April and the beginning of May. And they chose the earliest one, which is good actually with the exams coming up in May.\n#Person1#: Right. And how many are coming? Did you say about 12?\n#Person2#: Yes, they said 12 at first, but changed to 10 this morning.\n#Person1#: Good. We have 8 weeks to prepare. Here are my suggestions. On the first day, a welcome party. Then they can visit the schools in the district on the second and third days.\n#Person2#: We've got to remember this group wants to look at how computers are being used in the classroom.\n#Person1#: Exactly. So I want to ask Mr. Goodman to give them a talk on this on the afternoon of the third day.\n#Person2#: That'll fit in very nicely.\n#Person1#: And on their last day, they want to do some sightseeing. We could take them on a tour of London. But many of them may have been there already. And Schottland will be too far away.\n#Person2#: Why not take them for a walk along the coast? It should be interesting.\n#Person1#: Good idea, Cathy. I'm sure they'll like it.
#Person1#: Mike, I'm going to Washington tomorrow, do you have anything to be taken to professor Yang?\n#Person2#: Yes, Helen. I finished the article, if you will take it to him that will save me a trip.\n#Person1#: I'm glad to.\n#Person2#: Please ask him to read the article and point out any mistakes and I will try to correct them when I take it back.\n#Person1#: Have you printed it out?\n#Person2#: Not yet. Someone else is using the machine.\n#Person1#: Then can you print it before 4:50?\n#Person2#: Sure, I will take it to your office.
#Person1#: The WHO reports about 1. 6 billion adults were overweight. Of which at least 400 million were too fat.\n#Person2#: Fatness can bring more trouble for People.\n#Person1#: What's worse, men who were overweight at the age of 18 had nearly 50% less chance of being married by their 30s and 40s.\n#Person2#: You mean women list a man's appearance first?\n#Person1#: Sure! 500,000 Swedish men born between 1951 and 1961 were surveyed.\n#Person2#: I must watch my weight from now on.\n#Person1#: Yeah, you should in my opinion.
#Person1#: You look so fit, Nathan? What do you often do at the gym?\n#Person2#: Well, I try to work on specific back and lower back muscles with barbells. But I don't like gyms so much, you know.\n#Person1#: Why not?\n#Person2#: Because I find that many gyms are not really gyms, there just socializing places. You just sit on a machine and talk with others for like 45 minutes, \n#Person1#: Uhh, I see.
#Person1#: Hello and welcome to our program, Working Abroad. Our guest this evening is a Londoner, who lives and works in Italy. Her name's Susan Hill. Susan, welcome to the program. You live in Florence. How long have you been living there?\n#Person2#: since nineteen eighty two, but when I went there in nineteen eighty two, I plan to stay for only 6 months.\n#Person1#: Why did you change your mind?\n#Person2#: Well, soon after I arrived in Florence, I got a job with one of Italy's Top companies, Ferragamo, so I decided to stay.\n#Person1#: Oh, lucky. Do you still work for Ferragamo now?\n#Person2#: No, I left there in nineteen eighty eight. I've been a free designer since then. I've designed for some Italian companies as well as to American companies and in the last 5 years I've also been designing for the British company Burberry.\n#Person1#: What have you been designing for them?\n#Person2#: Mostly handbags and sometimes shoes and leather jackets.\n#Person1#: How's your industry changed since nineteen eighty two?\n#Person2#: It's become a lot more competitive because the quality of products from other countries has improved a lot, but Italian quality and design is still world famous.\n#Person1#: Well, thank you for talking to us, Susan.
#Person1#: Tina, my shirt is too tight, isn't it? Some of my friends were laughing at me today.\n#Person2#: Yes, it is a little tight. Let's buy you a new one. Oh look here, dear. This shirt costs only $24 on the Internet. I've seen it for 40 in the shops.\n#Person1#: But don't you think it looks rather unfashionable?\n#Person2#: No, I think it will suit you well. I'm going to buy you one.\n#Person1#: On the Internet?\n#Person2#: Yes, then we don't have to go out. They say it can be delivered in 48 hours.\n#Person1#: But I don't think it's safe to share our credit card information with a stranger.\n#Person2#: That's not a problem. They have a third party safety control.\n#Person1#: But I can't try it on before buying.\n#Person2#: Don't worry. They have different sizes and colors. I will order your size and your favorite color, brown, right?\n#Person1#: But what if I'm not satisfied with the quality?\n#Person2#: If we are not satisfied. We will return the T-shirt and they will return our money.\n#Person1#: Ok, then let's try shopping on the Internet.
#Person1#: Hello, I'd like to mail these books and clothes to Australia. How much will that cost?\n#Person2#: It depends on how much they weigh. Let's see, it's 5 pounds. So that will be $30.\n#Person1#: Let me take some stuff out to make it cheaper. There, how much now?\n#Person2#: It's 4 pounds now, so that will be $25.\n#Person1#: OK, I'll take out a few more items. Alright, how about now?\n#Person2#: Now it comes to $15 at 2 and a half pounds.\n#Person1#: OK, that works. Can I get a shipping number so that I know when it arrives?\n#Person2#: Yes, of course. We also offer insurance for $5.\n#Person1#: No, thanks.\n#Person2#: Would you like express shipping for an extra $10?\n#Person1#: No, regular shipping is fine.
#Person1#: Aren't you getting off at the next stop?\n#Person2#: You're right. That's where I usually get off for the office. But it's early so I thought I'd stay on as far as the High Street and do a couple of things there.\n#Person1#: Some shopping?\n#Person2#: Yes, after I've given this book back, I've just finished the last chapter and it's a few days late, so I have to pay a fine, but it is worth it.\n#Person1#: Then, which shop are you going to? You said you need a new jacket.\n#Person2#: I've already bought it. I'm going to buy Adele's new CD.
#Person1#: Come in, please.\n#Person2#: Good morning! I am Anna Lu. I've come for an interview which was arranged.\n#Person1#: Oh, I see. I am Jack White, Personnel Manager. Take a seat, please.\n#Person2#: Glad to meet you, Mr. White.\n#Person1#: Miss Lu, have you got any experience in restaurant service?\n#Person2#: Yes. Since I entered college, I have been working at a fast food restaurant as a part-time waitress.\n#Person1#: For how long?\n#Person2#: 3 years.\n#Person1#: Our restaurant receives a lot of foreign customers. Can you serve them in English?\n#Person2#: That's why I applied for this job. Now I am studying Hotel English in my college, and I am quite familiar with the western courtesy and restaurant etiquette. I am sure my public relation skills will leave a strong impression on your customers.\n#Person1#: You must know our working hours are very long and overtime work is frequent.\n#Person2#: I don't mind that.\n#Person1#: I think I will give you a 3 months ' trial. The salary for this period is 800 yuan a month with no bonus. After that period if we both feel satisfied, a formal contract would be signed.\n#Person2#: When am I supposed to start working?\n#Person1#: Next monday. Bring your resume and diploma with you.\n#Person2#: Yes, I will. Thank you, Mr. White. Goodbye!\n#Person1#: Goodbye!
#Person1#: Are you ready to order, madam?\n#Person2#: I'm on a diet. So I have to avoid food containing too much fat. Do you have vegetarian dishes?\n#Person1#: Yes, We do have some choices for ladies like you. What about some green salad?\n#Person2#: Does it taste good?\n#Person1#: Sure. It's a popular dish among young ladies.\n#Person2#: I think I'll try it.\n#Person1#: We have three kinds of dressings for salad. Italian, French and Thousand Island. Which one would you like?\n#Person2#: French, please.\n#Person1#: OK. Do you want to order something else?\n#Person2#: Milan Style Macaroni. Don't put sugar or salt on it, please.
#Person1#: I'd like to order a restock on my minibar.\n#Person2#: You finished everything in there, sir?\n#Person1#: Absolutely everything.\n#Person2#: What would you like to order?\n#Person1#: Three bottles each of Perrier and Jim Beam.\n#Person2#: Uh-huh. What else do you want?\n#Person1#: The apples were great. Could you bring a couple more up?\n#Person2#: No problem. Is there anything else I can get for you?\n#Person1#: Some grape juice would also be nice.\n#Person2#: I'll get all of that for you right away. Someone should be up shortly
#Person1#: Howdy! Nice car! What seems to be the problem?\n#Person2#: I don't know! This stupid old car started spewing white smoke and it just died on me. Luckily, I managed to start it up and drive it here. What do you think it is?\n#Person1#: Not sure yet. How about you pop the hood and we can take a look. Mmmm, it doesn't look good.\n#Person2#: What do you mean? My daddy gave me this car for my birthday last month. It's brand new!\n#Person1#: Well missy, the white smoke that you saw is steam from the radiator. You overheated your engine so now the pistons are busted and so is your transmission. You should have called us and we could have towed you over here when your car died.\n#Person2#: Ugh. . . So how long is this going to take? An hour?\n#Person1#: I'm afraid a bit more than that. We need to order the spare parts, take apart your electrical system, fuel pump and engine and then put it back together again. You are going to have to leave it here for at least two weeks.\n#Person2#: What! How am I supposed to get to school or go shopping? This is not happening!
#Person1#: Well, what is your trouble?\n#Person2#: I'm not feeling well, doctor. I have a sore throat.\n#Person1#: Have you any aches and pains?\n#Person2#: Yes, my back aches.\n#Person1#: I'll take your temperature. How long have you been feeling ill?\n#Person2#: It began the night before last.\n#Person1#: You have a temperature, but it's nothing serious. It's probably just the flu. I'll give you a prescription. Take this to the chemist's. Take one tablet every four hours. You should stay in bed tom\n#Person2#: Lots of people are ill at the moment.\n#Person1#: It's this cold weather we're having.
#Person1#: Would you like to go to the theater with me tomorrow?\n#Person2#: Yes, of course. Have you got the tickets?\n#Person1#: That's coincidence, someone's just returned two tickets and I picked them.\n#Person2#: Matinee or evening?\n#Person1#: Evening.\n#Person2#: Circle or stalls?\n#Person1#: Stalls.\n#Person2#: Wonderful, I'll go with you.
#Person1#: Anyone home? Jen!\n#Person2#: I'm in the kitchen. . . let yourself in!\n#Person1#: Wow! You're really working up a storm!\n#Person2#: I know. I've even worked up a sweat.\n#Person1#: You look like a cooking show host--only messier.
#Person1#: Do you have a family tradition at Christmas time?\n#Person2#: We have so Ay! But my favorite happens at Christmas Eve.\n#Person1#: What is it?\n#Person2#: Well, all the brothers and sisters get together and fill the Christmas stockings for the litt 1e kids.\n#Person1#: That's it? That's the tradition?\n#Person2#: Well, in fact it's fun for us to just be together that night and do this one thing.\n#Person1#: I guess the spirit of it is what really makes any tradition fun.\n#Person2#: You should be there some Christmas Eve.
#Person1#: Thank you for your letter.\n#Person2#: Is your waist any better?\n#Person1#: Yes, I'm feeling very well these days.\n#Person2#: I'm glad you are getting better.\n#Person1#: And I was glad to receive your letter.\n#Person2#: Then when will you be back again?\n#Person1#: I will be back again next Wednesday.\n#Person2#: I hope to see you at that time again. Bye.\n#Person1#: Bye.
#Person1#: Let's go see pandas! The news said that two pandas arrived at the zoo last week.\n#Person2#: Great! I would like to see cute pandas, too.\n#Person1#: How can we get there?\n#Person2#: We can take the MET and get off at the Zoo Station.\n#Person1#: OK! Let's go.\n#Person2#: ( At the zoo ) Wow! This zoo is really huge.\n#Person1#: Yes, you can find hundreds of various animals here. It is the biggest zoo in Taiwan.\n#Person2#: Look at the map. It has different areas, such as marine lives, mammals, polar animals and insects.\n#Person1#: Where can find the pandas? I think we are here to see the pandas.\n#Person2#: We have to go to the mammal area. We are at the gate right now. We need to go straight from here and turn left and go along to the end and make anotherleft turn.\n#Person1#: It should take at least 20 minutes to get there. Are there any shuttle buses running place to place around the whole zoo?
#Person1#: I think it's high time we had lunch.\n#Person2#: Of course. I can eat a horse now.\n#Person1#: I am sorry for that. I was so attracted by the beautiful scenery.\n#Person2#: Where shall we go now? A Chinese restaurant or a local one?\n#Person1#: I suppose the local one.
#Person1#: We're going to the movies. Will you join us?\n#Person2#: I'm very sorry I can't.\n#Person1#: Why not?\n#Person2#: I'm afraid I have some business to attend to.\n#Person1#: Then would you like to have lunch with us?\n#Person2#: I'd love to but I have to help John with his math problems right now.\n#Person1#: Would you like me to give you a lift?\n#Person2#: No, thanks. His home is not far and I can walk there.\n#Person1#: Come on. It's no trouble at all.\n#Person2#: Ok, thank you.
#Person1#: what do you hope to do when you finish university?\n#Person2#: I'd like to go into management. I'Ve applied for several jobs already and I'm hopeful that I'll get some job offers. How about you?\n#Person1#: after I graduate, I have to do some more studies to pass exams to become a lawyer. I think I'Ve got a good chance of passing. There's a possibility of getting a job with a law firm in London, provide\n#Person2#: we both have to overcome several obstacles if we are to achieve our ambitions.\n#Person1#: if life were easy, then we'd achieve our ambition quickly and then get bored.\n#Person2#: unfortunately, it's inevitable that some people are going to work hard yet not succeed.\n#Person1#: that's why ambition need to be realistic. You can't achieve something that's totally unrealistic.\n#Person2#: as long as you plan carefully, most thing are possible. It's always good to have a backup plan in case things go wrong.\n#Person1#: I think it's important to be successful in a field you are truly interested in, not something that other people force you to be interested it.\n#Person2#: my father wanted me to become a doctor, but I knew it would be impossible for me to be successful in that field.\n#Person1#: I hope my parents don't try to interfere in my choice of career.
#Person1#: Which service offered by your bank do you use most?\n#Person2#: I use several services. Of course, I deposit and withdraw money quite often. I often use my ATM card to take money out of my current account. I use my bank to exchange money from once currency to another. I often travel abroad, you see.\n#Person1#: Do you ever ask you bank for traveller's cheques? They are much safer than carrying lots of cash around.\n#Person2#: I sometimes use traveller's cheques, but sometimes I travel to countries where they are hard to exchange for cash.\n#Person1#: Do you use your bank to pay your utility bills? I use direct debit.\n#Person2#: Yes, I do. It save me a lot of time. I also have standing orders for my subscriptions to magazines.\n#Person1#: That's good idea. You don't need to worry about missing an issue of a magazine if you do that. I suppose you have a mortgage too.\n#Person2#: Yes. My bank offers very good terms and conditions on mortgage. There's a lot of competition between banks nowadays. Each one is trying to offer better conditions and services than the others.\n#Person1#: I have a deposit account with my bank. There are some restrictions on withdrawing money, but the interest rate is much higher.\n#Person2#: I don't have one. I prefer to buy shares. My bank also provides a share trading service. It's cheap and easy to use.\n#Person1#: That's great. But I prefer to put my money somewhere where the returns are more certain.
#Person1#: This is how a holiday should be. Relaxing on the beach with a nice cool drink.\n#Person2#: Isn't it wonderful here? The kids are enjoying themselves in the swimming pool. I hope it's safe.\n#Person1#: Don't worry about them. They're very responsible. Besides, there are many people there and there's lifeguard employed by the hotel. Waiter! Could I have another drink pleas? Thank you. So, what shall we do this evening?\n#Person2#: The kids said that they wanted to go to a party at the hotel. There's a special one just for kids.\n#Person1#: So, we could try that restaurant that was recommended in the guidebook. Then we could go to a club. We haven't been to one for ages.\n#Person2#: That's a great idea. We can really enjoy ourselves without worrying about the kids.\n#Person1#: Now, how about going for a swim in the sea? We shouldn't sunbathe all day.
#Person1#: Peter, have you finished your English composition?\n#Person2#: No. But I'm working on it.\n#Person1#: Class starts in twenty minutes. You have to turn it in at the beginning of class today.\n#Person2#: I know. I know!\n#Person1#: Do you think you can finish it on time?\n#Person2#: Don't worry. I'll get it done very soon. I'm almost finished.\n#Person1#: You'd better hurry!\n#Person2#: Well, it would be a lot easier to finish if you stopped talking to me.\n#Person1#: Sorry!
#Person1#: I remember you said that you like China because it has cheap beers.\n#Person2#: Yes, unbelievably cheap. Carlsborg is less than $ 1.\n#Person1#: Why do you drink? I mean, where does drinking get you?\n#Person2#: It's fashionable.\n#Person1#: Come on, you don't even know that blinds following is a sign of immaturity.\n#Person2#: Mary, it's not about the blind following. What matter is I enjoy in drinking. It's like when you get off of work. You're so tired. You need to get relaxed. You can't just turn on the TV and keep watch the programs until you fall asleep. You need to make your after work time more fun.\n#Person1#: How? By drinking?\n#Person2#: Drinking is just part of it. I mean, you have a bunch of friends coming by and having fun. You drink and talk. And the more you drink, the more you talk. It makes me so relaxed.\n#Person1#: When did you begin to drink?\n#Person2#: It's a long time ago. When I first went to a bar to pick up girls there, I saw the most beautiful girl sitting and sipping a coke. Then I went up to her and said'can I buy you a drink? '\n#Person1#: And then?\n#Person2#: Then I talked to her and got her number. You know what? When you don't know what to say? Just drink.\n#Person1#: So you get drunk every day?
#Person1#: My old man always harps on me.\n#Person2#: So does my father. I'm already used to it.\n#Person1#: But I can't bear it, John.\n#Person2#: How dare you say that? What they do is just for our good.\n#Person1#: Yeah, but he really puts blame on me.
#Person1#: Have you heard that we will have reorganization?\n#Person2#: No, really?\n#Person1#: Yes, flexible, aggressive and creative people are urgently needed in the marketing department.\n#Person2#: Who will be there?\n#Person1#: James is going to be packed off there.\n#Person2#: That is good. He can leave you alone this time.
#Person1#: Hey, Mike. You've been surfing the Net for quite a while. What on earth are you searching for?\n#Person2#: It's something relative hackers. I often hear people talking about them, but I don't know much about them.\n#Person1#: Well, roughly speaking, a hacker is a computer buff.\n#Person2#: You mean a guy using enthusiastic and knowledgeable about the computer?\n#Person1#: You can say that.\n#Person2#: But why are people always having such a negative attitude towards them?\n#Person1#: They must have mixed hackers with crackers.\n#Person2#: What is crackers then?\n#Person1#: There is another group of people who loudly call themselves hackers, but they aren't. They break into computers and break the phone system. Real hackers call these people crackers, and want nothing to do with them.\n#Person2#: So they are two totally different concepts.\n#Person1#: Well, the real hackers mostly think crackers are lazy, irresponsible and not very bright, and feel that being able to break security does make you a hacker any more than being able to start cars without keys makes you an automotive engineer. Unfortunately, many journalists and writers have been fooled into using the word hacker to describe crackers. This irritates real hackers to no end.\n#Person2#: I see. Then the basic different is, hackers build things, crackers break them.\n#Person1#: You got it.\n#Person2#: Thanks a lot.\n#Person1#: You are welcome.
#Person1#: Kate, what do you like to do tonight? Do you often go to the movies?\n#Person2#: Of course. I often go to the movies.\n#Person1#: There's a good movie called Summer in Beijing.\n#Person2#: I heard it's a very good movie.\n#Person1#: Let's find out what time it starts.\n#Person2#: Let's look at the newspaper.\n#Person1#: Here it is. It starts at 8 o'clock.\n#Person2#: Wonderful. I'm so excited.
#Person1#: Here we are, Ryan! This is where we're going to celebrate!\n#Person2#: It's a ETV palace! I'm glad I brought my platinum card.\n#Person1#: You won't need it. Stanley, my best man, is going to treat everybody!\n#Person2#: Where is Stanley? It was his idea to have the bachelor's party at a ETV, wasn't it?\n#Person1#: If it were up to Stanley, we'd have the wedding in the ETV! He loves to sing.\n#Person2#: Then I bet he's really good!\n#Person1#: Well, uh, I'll let you decide that for yourself. He'll be here a little later. Here's our room!
#Person1#: Excuse me, is this the office of the Textile Corporation?\n#Person2#: Yes, What can I do for you?\n#Person1#: I'm from CTC Trade Company.

Do sit down, won't you?\n#Person1#: Thank you, Ms. In. I'm here to discuss the possibility of establishing business relations with your corporation.\n#Person2#: We'd be very glad to do so.

I'll get them for you right away. Would you please sign this bill first? Thank you, sir.
#Person1#: Let me get last week's notes.\n#Person2#: Yeah, sure, you didn't come to class that day?\n#Person1#: I couldn't come.\n#Person2#: Why not?\n#Person1#: I wasn't feeling well.\n#Person2#: Here they are.\n#Person1#: Thanks a lot ; are these all the notes?\n#Person2#: Oh, no, this is the rest.\n#Person1#: Thank you very much.\n#Person2#: It's no problem at all.
#Person1#: When you are in a restaurant and you want the waiter to bring the bill, what do you do to attract his attention?\n#Person2#: I just make eye contact with him and nod my head. Then I tell him when he comes over to the table. Why do you ask?\n#Person1#: I went out with my girlfriend to a nice restaurant last night and I noticed that many people shouted for the bill.\n#Person2#: That seems a little impolite in such a restaurant.\n#Person1#: That's what I thought. I just thought I'd ask you and see what you thought of it. Anyway, what did you do yesterday evening?\n#Person2#: Well, it was a warm evening, so I stretched my legs. I walked along the canal for a couple of miles. Actually, several other people had the same idea. I saw Bill.\n#Person1#: Did you? How is he these days?\n#Person2#: He seemed ok. We didn't stop and chat because we were on opposite banks of the canal. We just waved at each other.\n#Person1#: I need to move some furniture. Could you help me to lift it?\n#Person2#: Of course. What do you want to move first?\n#Person1#: Let's move the sofa. Can you get a grip on the bottom at that end? I'll lift this end. I want to move it sideways in that direction.
#Person1#: I've been standing here since half past seven. Where on earth have you been?\n#Person2#: I'm terribly sorry I'm late. I just couldn't help it.\n#Person1#: It's really very easy saying you're sorry.\n#Person2#: Look, just give me a chance. I can explain it.
#Person1#: How many people are in your family?\n#Person2#: As you know, china has a single-child policy. Therefore, there's just my husband, my daughter and I. What about in your family?\n#Person1#: I have one daughter and one son. Then there's my husband and I. What about your parents? Do they live with your family?\n#Person2#: Not anymore. They live with my brother now. and yours?\n#Person1#: My parents live by themselves now. When they get older, they'll probably go to a retirement home. Do you just have one brother?\n#Person2#: No, I have two older brothers and one younger sister. What about you?\n#Person1#: I also grew up in a big family. I have one older brother and three younger sisters.\n#Person2#: How long have you been married?\n#Person1#: About seven years now. and you?\n#Person2#: I ' Ve been married for about five years. What do you think about divorce?\n#Person1#: It's becoming more and more common. However, I don't ever want to get divorced myself! What about you?\n#Person2#: If my husband cheated on me or treated me badly, I would get a divorce.\n#Person1#: If that happens, maybe you could marry my brother and we could become in-laws!\n#Person2#:  Haha, interesting. I'll keep that in mind, but don't tell my husband.\n#Person1#: Of course not!
#Person1#: How do I order the office supplies that I need?\n#Person2#: Fill out this form with whatever you need.

Have a great day!\n#Person1#: Good-bye!
#Person1#: You didn't show up in the morning meeting. What's up?\n#Person2#: Well, I just came in. I worked overtime yesterday. Some statistics and very important documents seemed to be inaccurate. So I stayed to double check them. The boss was aware of my very late work of last night. So before he left office, he told me I could come one hour later this morning.\n#Person1#: But you still look a little bit tired. What time did you leave?\n#Person2#: It was around 1 thirty in the morning. I guess I didn't fall asleep till 3 because those numbers were involving in my mind. I just couldn't stop thinking about them.\n#Person1#: That's normal after a tense work evening. Working overtime is not always a pleasant experience for me either. Once, I worked overtime everyday for a whole week including the weekend. That really broke my rhythm and I got a little sick later.\n#Person2#: Working at weekend is something I hate to do most.\n#Person1#: But if the company asks, what else can we do?
#Person1#: Good morning, Wilson Association.\n#Person2#: This is Brown speaking. I'd like to speak to Mr. Tomas.\n#Person1#: I'm sorry, but Mr. Tomas left here just a few minutes ago.\n#Person2#: I've been trying to call him for the last ten minutes, but your line was busy.

He is away for the rest of the day.\n#Person2#: Is there any other way I can reach him?\n#Person1#: I'm afraid not, he has gone out of this town on business. May I take a message?\n#Person2#: I have a business appointment with him at ten o'clock tomorrow morning, but I'm afraid I can't make it.\n#Person1#: Would you like to make another appointment?\n#Person2#: Unfortunately, I'm leaving here unexpectedly, and I may be away for several days.\n#Person1#: I see. I'll tell Mr. Tomas you've called.\n#Person2#: Thank you.
#Person1#: Good morning, can I help you?\n#Person2#: We'd like to check out. Would you please give me our bill?\n#Person1#: Certainly. What are your room numbers and your name, please?\n#Person2#: We are in Rooms 204 to 210. I'm Jenny, the tour guide of the group. My room number is 205.\n#Person1#: Just a moment, please, Jenny. I'll have your final bill ready in a minute.\n#Person2#: OK, but we're in a bit of a rush. We'd like to go downtown for shopping.\n#Person1#: Sorry to keep you waiting. It'll be just a moment...

#Person1#: Excuse me, sir, but are you Mr. Robertson from Australia?\n#Person2#: Yes, I am.\n#Person1#: How do you do, Mr. Robertson? Welcome to Beijing!\n#Person2#: How do you do?\n#Person1#: I'm Lily.\n#Person2#: Oh, it's great to meet you, Miss Lily.\n#Person1#: I'm also glad to meet you. Please come this way. That's our car. Your baggage can go in the boot.\n#Person2#: Good.\n#Person1#: Is this your first visit to Beijing?\n#Person2#: This is my first visit to China. It has been my long-cherished desire to pay a visit to your beautiful country.\n#Person1#: You are going to stay in Beijing for...\n#Person2#: Five days. And then I have to fly to Xi'an. My wife will be waiting for me in Hong Kong. But on my way to Hong Kong I will visit Guilin first.\n#Person1#: That's a wonderful idea. Well, Mr. Robertson, were you born in Australia?\n#Person2#: No, I was born in London.\n#Person1#: No wonder I can understand you so well.\n#Person2#: Yes, I speak British English with a bit of an Australian accent.\n#Person1#: I find it hard to understand some Australian friends who speak Australian English.\n#Person2#: Do you? I think it is because we Australians speak very quickly.

It gets very cold. It snows a lot.\n#Person1#: Do you go alone?\n#Person2#: A couple of my friends usually go with me. Do you want to come along some weekend?\n#Person1#: No, not me. I don't like cold weather.\n#Person2#: I really like it. I love snow!
#Person1#: Hello, Mr. Jackson.\n#Person2#: Hello, Mrs. Jones. Come in and sit down. What's the matter?\n#Person1#: I have a pain in my tooth.\n#Person2#: Do you often have this pain?\n#Person1#: No, I don't.

It's very painful.\n#Person2#: Yes, I'll give you pills. Take one three one three times a day, and come here in three days. I'll pull it if necessary.
#Person1#: I'm losing my sleep. I feel tired and sleepy all the time. I've got to do something about it.\n#Person2#: I'm so sorry for you. But what are you going to do?\n#Person1#: I want to move out of the dorm and rent a small flat.\n#Person2#: That's a good idea. It will be much more convenient for you.\n#Person1#: But I need your help.\n#Person2#: How? To find one person for you?\n#Person1#: Yes\n#Person2#: I'll sleep on it tonight and tell you my decision tomorrow. OK?

#Person1#: What's the matter with you, then? You look miserable. \n#Person2#: It's us. \n#Person1#: What do you mean by 'us'? \n#Person2#: Well, we used to talk to each other before we were married. Remember? \n#Person1#: What do you mean? We 're talking now, aren't we? \n#Person2#: Oh, yes, but we used to do so much together. \n#Person1#: Yes. I remember. But we never used to argue. You used to think I was wonderful. Where are you going? \n#Person2#: Back to live with my parents. That's something else I used to do before we were married. Remember? 
#Person1#: Hi Jane, you look great. \n#Person2#: You too. Have you lost some weight? \n#Person1#: Yes, I took off 4 kilos. I am glad you notice it. \n#Person2#: Not some crazy diet fat I hope. \n#Person1#: No no, I just changed my eating habits. I eat a balance meal. and I eat less than before. \n#Person2#: Good for you, keep it up. 
#Person1#: Want to go with me to get some pizza, Sophie?\n#Person2#: No, Black. I'm waiting for a package to be delivered.\n#Person1#: This is why I hate shopping online. It would be faster to just get what you want from the store. Now you have to sit here all day. Isn't Mom home?\n#Person2#: No, Mom went to work.\n#Person1#: Just download an app to keep track of your package. You can just come back when you get a delivery notice.\n#Person2#: No, thanks, Mr. Bossy. Even if they leave the package for a short time, someone could steal it.\n#Person1#: Goodness! You just don't want to be seen with your little brother!\n#Person2#: It's not that. I really did plan to stay home and wait for this package. Why don't we just have pizza delivered?\n#Person1#: Great. More waiting.
#Person1#: You are not looking very cheerful. What's the matter with you?\n#Person2#: Oh, nothing special. I'm just thinking a lot.\n#Person1#: About the job?\n#Person2#: About everything. About catching the same train every morning, sitting in the same office all day and watching the same television program.\n#Person1#: You need a holiday.\n#Person2#: It wasn't always like this, you know.\n#Person1#: What do you mean?\n#Person2#: Well, our great great grandfathers had more fun, didn't they? I mean, they haunted for their food and grow their own vegetables and dip things for themselves. We do the same sort of job for years and years. There's no variety in our lives.\n#Person1#: You need a holiday. That's what the matter is with you.
#Person1#: Excuse me, Sir. But could you not smoke here? I'm pregnant.\n#Person2#: Of course, I'm sorry, ma'am. I actually hate it too, but I can't quit.\n#Person1#: I know it's not easy, but many of my friends have succeeded in quitting.\n#Person2#: Really? How did they do it?\n#Person1#: They quit for their family, they decided to give up smoking after they got married.\n#Person2#: So, are you married?\n#Person1#: No, I'm only 22 years old.\n#Person2#: Then you must have started smoking at an early age.\n#Person1#: Yes, I started 5 years ago, I was copying my father. Now I know that was a mistake. But it's too late.\n#Person2#: It's not too late. You must believe that if you just try, you can do it.\n#Person1#: Thanks.\n#Person2#: So, does your father still smoke?\n#Person1#: Not since he got throat cancer. I was really scared when I was told the news.\n#Person2#: Smoking is really harmful. The earlier you stop smoking the better it is.\n#Person1#: You are right. Anyway, I'll keep trying.
#Person1#: I'm having problems getting into the school email system. It keeps telling me that my password is wrong.\n#Person2#: Hum when was the last time you checked your email?\n#Person1#: Beats me! Sometime last week, maybe Monday.\n#Person2#: Well, if you keep having the problem, you can go to the school IT center. Show the teachers there your student card and they will give you a new password. You can then get in with the new one.\n#Person1#: But where is the IT center?\n#Person2#: Oh, it's in the rounds building, behind Frost Wu. Over there, you see?\n#Person1#: Yes, thank you very much.\n#Person2#: You're welcome. By the way, the center isn't open now. It's closed every Tuesday afternoon. You'd better go there tomorrow.
#Person1#: Is it me or is it really hard to understand this speaker?\n#Person2#: You're right, it's not that he has an accent like some of the other speakers from another country. It's just that he is speaking too softly. Do you think it would be rude to ask him to turn his microphone up a little bit?\n#Person1#: I don't think he's wearing one, either that or he's turned it off.\n#Person2#: That's crazy, there must be 400 people here.\n#Person1#: This part of the conference has turned into such a waste of time. Maybe we should leave and try to find another lecture.\n#Person2#: I can't do that. I come here specifically to hear this guys speech. I think I'll just go up to him at the end of the speech and try to ask him some questions.\n#Person1#: Good idea, would you mind if I followed you up there? It might be the only way to get anything out of this hour?\n#Person2#: No problem.
#Person1#: Hi Jeff, how was your weekend?\n#Person2#: It was great, Mary. How was yours?\n#Person1#: My mother's birthday was Saturday and we had a great time. We had dinner at home and then watched an old movie. When they told me it was almost 70 years old. I thought it was going to be boring. But it was one of the best movies I've ever seen. I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. I laughed, I cried, I got angry.\n#Person2#: Wow. Now I want to see it.\n#Person1#: I'm dying to watch it again. Hey, why don't we get together and have a party and we can see the movie together.\n#Person2#: That's a great idea. I can bring some friends, if that's OK.\n#Person1#: Sure. I'll ask my mom to watch it with us. She can tell us all about the stars. Let's say 6:00 o'clock on Saturday.
#Person1#: Hi, can I help you?\n#Person2#: Yes, I saw your ad in today's newspaper. It says that you need to hire an assistant. Can you tell me some information about the job?\n#Person1#: OK. Well, we manage a very busy agency. The assistant will help by answering phones and typing documents. The problem is that you'll have to concentrate in a noisy environment. Can you handle that?\n#Person2#: Yes, I have worked for busy organizations before.\n#Person1#: And how fast can you type?\n#Person2#: I type 60 words per minute.\n#Person1#: Great. Feel free to come down and pick up an application from me. If we hire you, your position will be temporary for the first three months.\n#Person2#: That makes sense. Well, I look forward to meeting you.
#Person1#: Overseas operator, may I help you?\n#Person2#: Yes. I would like to place a collect call.\n#Person1#: Can you tell me the name and number of the person you want?\n#Person2#: Terry and his number is 4562325 8.\n#Person1#: Please wait a moment. It Will take a few seconds to get through.
#Person1#: All right. I want to bring everybody in on this project. When can we start working on this?\n#Person2#: Well, we could probably get started with a strategy meeting tomorrow morning at 8\n#Person1#: I tell you what, 800 is no good for me, but why don ' t you guys get started and I ' ll come by at around 8\n#Person2#: That ' s fine with me. How much time are we going to have to work on this?
#Person1#: What can I help you with today?\n#Person2#: My washing machine isn't working.\n#Person1#: What's the problem?\n#Person2#: The water will not drain.\n#Person1#: Is there anything else wrong with it?\n#Person2#: No, that's it.\n#Person1#: I can come down and fix that for you if you'd like.\n#Person2#: When will you be able to fix it?\n#Person1#: How does this afternoon at 2 thirty sound to you?\n#Person2#: That would be perfect.\n#Person1#: Alright, so I'll see you then?\n#Person2#: See you then.
#Person1#: Good morning, Madam. What can I do for you?\n#Person2#: I need to have some money transferred from the UK, from my company. It's kind of an emergency.\n#Person1#: That shouldn't be a problem, Madam. I'm sure we can sort this out for you quickly.\n#Person2#: That would be wonderful. The problem is I don't have an account with you. That is a problem, isn't it?\n#Person1#: Well, to be honest, it will slow things down a little. But it's not a big problem. You can do it by T / T.\n#Person2#: T / T? What on earth is that!? Sorry, but I've never heard of it. T / T?\n#Person1#: It means'telegraphic transfer'. So, if you use this way it's fast and secure and can be done from anywhere, to anywhere in the world.
#Person1#: Excuse me. We ordered too much. May we take the food home?\n#Person2#: Yes, surely.\n#Person1#: Do we have to pay extra charge for that?\n#Person2#: No, you don't. It is free of charge.\n#Person1#: Well, then, will you put this and that into doggie bags?\n#Person2#: Yes, certainly. Would you wait for a few minutes?\n#Person1#: Thanks. Would you do me another favor?\n#Person2#: Yes, what is it?\n#Person1#: Some more Chinese tea for us, please.\n#Person2#: Sure. I'll be back in a minute.
#Person1#: Welcome to Lincoln Bank. Are you a new customer?\n#Person2#: Yes, I am. I opened an account with you about a month ago, but today I'm here to see about a loan of some kind.\n#Person1#: I see. As you don't have a long history with us, we will have to check your credit rating with your previous bank before we can promise any loan to you.\n#Person2#: Yes, that's fine. My credit is good ; I banked at my former bank for many years.\n#Person1#: May I ask why you decided to switch your account to us?\n#Person2#: Haha! Actually, I felt that your array of services is much better than what my old bank had on offer. Plus, I've got plenty of friends who bank with you and they are extremely happy.\n#Person1#: We always welcome new business. If you can give me the details of your former bank, including your account number we can begin.\n#Person2#: I have everything right here. I'll let you go through that and come back. I'd like to have a good read of your materials to make sure I make the right choice.

I've always dreamed of going somewhere like Tibet, seeing something unique.\n#Person2#: great minds think alike. My brother and I have been thinking about going to Tibet for quite a long time. Do you have anything on your schedule?\n#Person1#: nothing particular.\n#Person2#: why don't you join us? We are leaving next week ; you'll still have a week to prepare.\n#Person1#: oh, Tibet sounds great, but I'm afraid it'll cost too much. Last time I traveled to India, and it cost me a fortune.\n#Person2#: come on! We're traveling on our own. It won't cost too much.\n#Person1#: ok, then count me in. where will we stay?\n#Person2#: the youth hotels are comfortable and cheap.\n#Person1#: then make sure that you book me a room, too.\n#Person2#: I'll take care of it.\n#Person1#: and check whether they accept credit cards.\n#Person2#: no problem.
#Person1#: I'm tired, Larry. Can we have a break?\n#Person2#: What? You're tired? But we just started about twenty minutes ago.\n#Person1#: I know, but I'm really tired. My stomach feels funny.\n#Person2#: What's the matter? Didn't you sleep well last night?\n#Person1#: I was too excited to sleep last night. I didn't go to sleep until quite late.\n#Person2#: Then when did you go to sleep?\n#Person1#: About 2 o'clock in the morning.\n#Person2#: When?\n#Person1#: About 2 o'clock.\n#Person2#: Oh, Susie. Didn't I tell you over and over again that you wouldn't be able to climb the mountain unless you got enough sleep?\n#Person1#: You did, but I can't help it.\n#Person2#: This is a one-day trip. We'll have to keep going and try to reach the top by noon or give up right now and go home. Which one do you choose?\n#Person1#: Which one do I choose? I don't want to give up, but I really feel tired.\n#Person2#: So, make up your mind quickly. Whether to keep going or give up.\n#Person1#: Let me think about it. What should I do? I think I will not give up.
#Person1#: Betty, would you please read this letter of application I've just written? I'd like to have your opinion.\n#Person2#: I'd be glad to tell you what I think.\n#Person1#: Good! I'm interested in your advice.\n#Person2#: If I were you, I would change the beginning. You should write about your education first because we like to judge a man by his abilities.\n#Person1#: Good idea, Betty. What would you think about the second part?\n#Person2#: I think it's too short. You'd better say something about your work experience.\n#Person1#: You're right, I'll change it. How about the last part?\n#Person2#: Very good. But you should talk about your family, too.\n#Person1#: I agree. I appreciate your helping me.
#Person1#: Thanks for coming shopping with me.\n#Person2#: I'm so honored that you thought to ask me.\n#Person1#: I've never given a speech in front of a thousand people before.\n#Person2#: You're going to do great. And you're going to look great.\n#Person1#: Thanks. Now let's decide which one of these suits looks best for this occasion.\n#Person2#: I still like the olive one best. There's a tailor here who can take up the sleeves for you.\n#Person1#: The question is, can he have it done before Friday?\n#Person2#: These guys are professional. I think they can have it done tomorrow. Let's ask.
#Person1#: what a nice uniform!\n#Person2#: thanks ; do you like it?\n#Person1#: not really. I was being sarcastic. Does it come with the job?\n#Person2#: yes, everyone on the sales floor has to wear one. They're supposed to make us look more professional.\n#Person1#: they're not actually that bad. They could be worse. What do you think about it?\n#Person2#: I don't mind it, actually. I don't have to worry about what I'm going to wear every day.\n#Person1#: so are you enjoying your new job?\n#Person2#: it's much better than my old one. My new boss is great.\n#Person1#: how do you like working in sales?\n#Person2#: I like the fact that I get to work with people. It makes the day go by much faster.\n#Person1#: that's good.

How does that sound?\n#Person2#: Maybe I'll go for the US dollar account.
#Person1#: Hi, I was wondering if you have my test results in.\n#Person2#: I didn't see anything out of the ordinary, but I want you to log onto our website for a printout of all of the details.\n#Person1#: So, basically, I am OK?\n#Person2#: If there were any major problems, I would always notify you by phone to come in.\n#Person1#: What will I learn when I see the results on the website?\n#Person2#: A description of each test is given on the site.\n#Person1#: What will the numbers tell me?\n#Person2#: The website will give you a normal range and then tell you what your results are.\n#Person1#: Are all of my test results on that site?\n#Person2#: Your entire test history is on the site.

It is a famous restaurant in the city.\n#Person1#: I'm afraid there must be a lot of people there.\n#Person2#: I think so. I think you'd better make a phone call to see whether there is a table available.\n#Person1#: But we don't know the telephone number.\n#Person2#: Here is a tourist guidebook.

I love football!\n#Person1#: You'Ve god a fever and playing football isn't a good idea for a boy with a fever. What's that on your arm?\n#Person2#: I don't know. It was there when I woke up this morning.\n#Person1#: It's a rash. I'd better take you to see the doctor. How did you get that bruise on your leg?\n#Person2#: I bashed it against the chair in my room.\n#Person1#: Does it hurt?\n#Person2#: A little, but not much.\n#Person1#: Here.

#Person1#: I've been reading about a new snack food. It's made from fish. Have you heard anything about it?\n#Person2#: No. I haven't, but I don't like fish very much anyway.\n#Person1#: Not to worry. Although it's made primarily from fish, it actually doesn't have a fishy taste. In fact, it can be flavored with tomato, cheese, or chocolate for instance\n#Person2#: How can it not taste fishy? Do you know how this snack food is made?\n#Person1#: First the fish is minced and cooked and fermented. Then water and starch are added to make a dough.\n#Person2#: It sounds awful.\n#Person1#: Actually the dough is very bland al that point, so the flavorings are added to give it some taste.\n#Person2#: Well, it still sounds a little strange. But I suppose this product will at least be low calorie and high protein. like a health food.\n#Person1#: Yes, you could call it that. And it has a long shelf life, so it won't spoil quickly. It is also easy to digest and can ha made from types of fish that usually aren't eaten, or from high grade fish by-products,\n#Person2#: Mm, have you got any samples? I might be willing to try the cheese-flavored variety.\n#Person1#: No, none of it seems to be available yet. As I understand it, this fish snack food probably won't be in the stores for another couple of years. So you'll have a while to get used to the whole idea.\n#Person2#: A couple of years, ah? It may just take me that long. but thanks for telling me about it.

I couldn't see anything.\n#Person1#: That sounds frightening.\n#Person2#: In my dream, I saw white light behind some trees. It was a strange light because it seemed to get bigger and then smaller as if it was alive. At first I just stood where I was. But then the light seemed to move toward me and I could see something in it like the face of an old man. I tried to run away, but my feet felt very heavy, and I couldn't run fast enough. That's when I woke up I was shaking all over.
#Person1#: We're so happy to have you here on the show with us today. So what was it like filming a movie in Iceland?\n#Person2#: Very cold. I had never been to Iceland before, so I didn't really know what to expect. There aren't a lot of people in the country and we were filming in this small fishing village, so it wasn't uncommon to go days without seeing anyone. The villagers mainly kept to themselves.\n#Person1#: I think everyone in the audience is dying to know if you hung out with Johnny Depp.\n#Person2#: Yes, of course. He was staying at the house, too.\n#Person1#: Well, what is he like?\n#Person2#: He's very nice. He also told some really great jokes.

Let's go somewhere else then. We can't take too long because we have a test at 3:00.\n#Person1#: OK, let's go to the library. There's another machine downstairs by the telephone.
#Person1#: Welcome back, everyone. Now I'm talking to Nick Parker, the singer with the band, Crispy. Hello, Nick. Welcome to our show.\n#Person2#: Hello.\n#Person1#: Nick, I have one question. Your sister Mel is in the band, too. Isn't she?\n#Person2#: Yeah, we've been playing and singing together since we were young. Dad took us to hear the great bands playing live, Mel and I put on shows at school. But mom didn't want us to get too serious about our music. She thought we should concentrate on our study. However, we were still enthusiastic about our music.\n#Person1#: Then how was your band formed?\n#Person2#: 2 musicians from music schools saw us playing in a concert. They asked if we'd like to form a band with them. We agreed to try it out.\n#Person1#: How about the band in the first year?\n#Person2#: To our surprise, the audiences enjoyed our performance in the local concert. Then we recorded 2 songs and sent them to a music company. They asked us to join them, but our parents said we had to finish college first.\n#Person1#: Have you had any disappointments?\n#Person2#: Everything we've recorded has done well. 3 singles have gone to number one and our first album has sold over 1,000,000 copies. We've got thousands of fans. However, I've been ill recently, so we've started recording our second album late, which is a pity.

If it hasn ' t been, we will still accept it.\n#Person1#: Can I mail it in early next time so it isn ' t late?\n#Person2#: Actually, you cannot mail it in early, as it needs to reflect all of the information up to the due date.\n#Person1#: Will my paycheck come right away now?\n#Person2#: Your check will arrive a little late.

I didn't forget, but I had no time at all.\n#Person1#: So you didn't. Is that right?\n#Person2#: Yes. I'm sorry.\n#Person1#: Why didn't you just answer my question directly? Why would Chinese answer questions this way? I simply asked if you did it or not. It's a very simple question. And Chinese often give the reason before they would give a direct answer.\n#Person2#: Yes, I'm sorry. I know it bothers you very much. But I don't know why Chinese sometimes would do this.\n#Person1#: You know, today I asked a student if he brought his dictionary with him. It's a rule I made for the class that everyone brings a bilingual dictionary with them because sometimes they don't understand me. The funniest thing is that this student gave me a lot of reasons and no direct answer.\n#Person2#: But you know if he brought it or not, right?\n#Person1#: Yeah, after all the explanations like, it's too heavy, I was in a hurry. . . whatever.

Spring is a lovely time to be in the mountains.\n#Person1#: Thank you for thinking of that.\n#Person2#: Maybe if we asked around we could see what people would prefer.\n#Person1#: That is a good idea.\n#Person2#: I'll take care of taking the survey and get back to you with the answers.

#Person1#: Would you please take a seat over there? There are some interesting magazines on the coffee-table.\n#Person2#: Thank you.

Are you in a hurry?\n#Person2#: No. I'm thinking that maybe I can get my hair shampooed.\n#Person1#: Good idea. Do you want a wash or a massage? Massage is especially good when you are tired.\n#Person2#: How come?\n#Person1#: Because it helps you speed up your circulation.\n#Person2#: Then I won't say no to that.\n#Person1#: How do you like it?\n#Person2#: I feel totally refreshed.\n#Person1#: We have discount coupons. 100 Yuan for ten times. Would you like to have one?\n#Person2#: This time included?\n#Person1#: Of course.\n#Person2#: Then yes.
#Person1#: I want to make dinner tonight.\n#Person2#: What are you thinking of making?\n#Person1#: I don't have any idea what to cook.\n#Person2#: How about making a teriyaki bowl?\n#Person1#: Can you tell me how to make it?\n#Person2#: All it consists of is teriyaki beef and white rice.\n#Person1#: Okay, but what do I have to do to prepare it?\n#Person2#: All you have to do is cook some white rice.\n#Person1#: What do I do after that?\n#Person2#: Then cut up the beef and marinate it in teriyaki sauce.\n#Person1#: What else do I have to do?\n#Person2#: All that's left is to cook it.

#Person1#: Madam, I made a close study of the draft contract yesterday evening. I think there are something needs to modify.\n#Person2#: Which terms?\n#Person1#: First, about the terms of payment. Your draft contract says that payment is to be made by D \ A. This is not our practice. We prefer to have the payment made by L \ C through a negotiating bank in America.\n#Person2#: Good. I will add this to the contract.\n#Person1#: The second thing I would like to point out, that is packaging. It's stipulated in the contract that all the computer parts should be packed in cardboard boxes. But I think the wooden cases are much safer.\n#Person2#: Well, you are right. Is there anything else?\n#Person1#: As far as the contract stipulations are concerned, there is nothing more. Thank you very much.\n#Person2#: Well, we have agreed on all the major points.
#Person1#: Did you enjoy your meal?\n#Person2#: Yes, we really enjoyed it.\n#Person1#: May I interest you in some dessert?\n#Person2#: Yes, that sounds great.\n#Person1#: Well, we have chocolate mousse cake, homemade fresh strawberry shortcake, and a spicy rum apple crisp for our specials.\n#Person2#: The apple crisp sounds great.\n#Person1#: Since there are four of you, would you like to split a second dessert?\n#Person2#: Good suggestion. Could you please bring us a chocolate mousse cake and four dessert forks, please?\n#Person1#: Would you like coffee or tea with your dessert?\n#Person2#: Let's have four coffees, please.\n#Person1#: OK. I will be right back with your desserts and drinks.\n#Person2#: Thank you! We have really enjoyed our meal here.
#Person1#: Hi, I'd like a single room.\n#Person2#: Do you have a reservation?\n#Person1#: No, I'm afraid not.\n#Person2#: Let me check if we have any vacancies. . . You're in luck. We have one single room available.\n#Person1#: How much is it?\n#Person2#: $ 60 a night. No charge for local calls on the phone or for the TV, unless you decide to watch the pay-per-view channels.\n#Person1#: Okay, I'll take it.\n#Person2#: Here's your key. Check out time is 12 noon.

Which way to the room?\n#Person2#: It's that way, on the second floor.\n#Person1#: Thanks.
#Person1#: May I help you at all?\n#Person2#: Yes, please. My son wants to go overseas, to England, to do his Master degree. I wondered if you offer any kind of loan that could assist him in doing so?\n#Person1#: We certainly do. I can give you some details about a loan called Personal Loan for Studying Abroad. We offer this to anyone who will study outside this country.\n#Person2#: I see. What does it entail? I'm not sure if we will be eligible.\n#Person1#: This loan is specially provided for people who are studying overseas to pay for their tuition fee and other sundry items.\n#Person2#: So, we could use it to pay for my son's living expenses, not just his tuition?\n#Person1#: That's right. The sundries could include accommodation, text books and so on. The guidelines are not so strict, you see.\n#Person2#: That is good to know. Just think! We've been worrying about this for weeks and just a short visit here and my mind is at ease. Thank you.
#Person1#: Excuse me. I've been waiting for over an hour. My appointment was scheduled for 11:00 a.m., and I have a meeting at 1:30 p.m. I took lunch early and then came straight here for my annual health examination.\n#Person2#: What's your name, sir?\n#Person1#: Peter Jennings.\n#Person2#: Let's see...you're next, Mr. Jennings. Dr. Watson is just finishing up with another patient. It should only be another couple of minutes.\n#Person1#: It took me two months to get this appointment. I'm just worried that I'll be late getting back to the office. If I'm late for my meeting, my boss will be upset.\n#Person2#: But you have a medical appointment. I'm sure he'll understand...\n#Person1#: It's a 'she', actually. The problem is that I'll give a presentation at the meeting. If I'm late, the whole thing will be...\n#Person2#: Oh, look who's here!\n#Person1#: Thank goodness! Dr. Watson...
#Person1#: Do you think you can take me to the Grand Hotel in 30 minutes?\n#Person2#: It depends. If the traffic isn't too heavy... Anyhow, I'll try my best.

#Person1#: The manager just emailed to say that the meeting would be put off till the next Sunday. Will you have everything ready by then? Anna, what's wrong? Are you hearing me?\n#Person2#: Sorry, I was thinking about my brother. I haven't heard from him for two weeks.\n#Person1#: How often do you call each other?\n#Person2#: Usually at least once a week, but he's now a volunteer teacher at a mountain village. I can only write to him.\n#Person1#: The mail can be really slow sometimes. I'm sure you'll hear from him soon.\n#Person2#: I hope so.
#Person1#: Hello!\n#Person2#: Hello! Glad to meet you.\n#Person1#: Tell me something about yourself, please.\n#Person2#: My name is Wan Mei and I live in Guangzhou. I was born in 1987. I am a student of Jinan University. I have majored in Public Administration, I like travelling very much and enjoy sports. I am in the tennis club at my university.\n#Person1#: Your application form says you were out of school for half a year during high school. What was the reason? Were you ill?\n#Person2#: Oh. No. My father's job took him to America for six months then, and he decided to take the whole family along.\n#Person1#: So during that time you went to high school in the United States?\n#Person2#: Yes, it was just for a few months. I attended Johnson High School in Chicago.\n#Person1#: Tell me why you are interested in working for this company, will you?\n#Person2#: I think working in this company would give me the best opportunity to use what I've learned at college, studying public administration for four years. I think this company has a great future. So for a long time I've been thinking I'd like to work for this company.\n#Person1#: Have you ever worked during your university days?\n#Person2#: Yes. I worked as a teacher to teach English to a middle school student.\n#Person1#: There's a good chance for you to come to work for this company. Thank you for coming. Good bye!\n#Person2#: Good bye!
#Person1#: Excuse me, but could you tell me when the plane for Berlin leaves?\n#Person2#: In 40 minutes, at eleven o'clock. The plane for Berlin leaves every two hours.\n#Person1#: How much is a second class ticket, please?\n#Person2#: We have only first class tickets left. It is $ 350 one way.\n#Person1#: OK.

By the way, what's the gate number?\n#Person2#: Four. Down the hall and to the left.\n#Person1#: Thanks a lot.
#Person1#: Hi, Mike. What have you been up to?\n#Person2#: Not much. I started exercising.\n#Person1#: Trying to get in shape?\n#Person2#: Yeah, and I need to start improving my health.\n#Person1#: Me, too. What are you doing besides exercising?\n#Person2#: That's about all.\n#Person1#: I think if you eat better, it will also help a lot.\n#Person2#: Sleep is important, too. I heard people who sleep an average of eight hours a day have less health problems.\n#Person1#: Looks like there are a lot of things to do to stay healthy.\n#Person2#: True. But I think it is worth it. When you get older, you want to be healthy and active.\n#Person1#: Absolutely.
#Person1#: Hello, Bob. I haven't seen you for a long time. How are you getting along with your preparations for the entrance exam?\n#Person2#: Well, I really can't tell. Anyhow, I'm doing my best, working night and day.\n#Person1#: So am I. Sometimes, I feel very tired, both physically and mentally.\n#Person2#: I feel the same. I often suffer from headaches and general weakness. Not enough time for sleeping. I don't know what will become of me if it goes on like this for long.\n#Person1#: And no time for sports, even music, not to mention films or TV programs. All we can see is exercises, exam papers and this sort of things.\n#Person2#: It seems that to go to college is the only future we have.\n#Person1#: Certainly not. Even if we can't go to college, we can take up many other jobs and do our bits for the society as well.\n#Person2#: Quite right. But we'll get more knowledge after studying several years at college. That means we can work better for our country and people after graduation. In addition our parents lay great hope on us, and we shouldn't make them feel disappointed.
#Person1#: Excuse me. What's the postage on this letter to New York, please?\n#Person2#: How would you like to send it?\n#Person1#: By registered airmail.\n#Person2#: Eighty cents, please. And please write down the postal code in the mailing address. Anything else?\n#Person1#: Yes. I'd like 6 postcards and 10 fifty-cent stamps, please.\n#Person2#: All right. Here you are.\n#Person1#: And this package is for London. Will you weigh it for me?\n#Person2#: Yes, of course. This package is 10 grams overweight. You'll have to pay 50 cents extra for the overweight.
#Person1#: Good evening, can I get you a drink? \n#Person2#: Sure, I would like a Coke. \n#Person1#: Would you like to order anything off the appetizer menu? \n#Person2#: Let's see, can I get some fried zucchini, please? \n#Person1#: Would you like to order anything else? \n#Person2#: No, that's it, thank you. \n#Person1#: No problem, call me when you're ready to place the rest of your order. \n#Person2#: I would like to order my food now. \n#Person1#: What did you want to order? \n#Person2#: Can I get a cheeseburger and some fries? \n#Person1#: Can I get you anything else? \n#Person2#: That's all, thank you. 
#Person1#: Can you tell me where I can park? \n#Person2#: Are you driving a motorcycle or an automobile? \n#Person1#: I drive an automobile. \n#Person2#: Fine. You can either park in the student lot or on the street. Do you know what a handicapped space is? \n#Person1#: Yes, I have seen those spots. \n#Person2#: Well, when you see the blue spots with the handicapped logo, do not park there unless you have a special permit. Are you going to be parking in the daytime or the evening? \n#Person1#: I park in the evenings. \n#Person2#: Then you also need to be aware of the time limits on the street signs. Have you seen those signs? \n#Person1#: Yes, I have seen those signs. \n#Person2#: The signs always tell you how long you can park there and on what days. Do you know how to read the curb colors? \n#Person1#: Yes, I know what the curb colors mean. \n#Person2#: Well, just as long as you realize that red means no parking and white means loading and unloading, I think you know what you need to know. 
#Person1#: People are funny. \n#Person2#: They sure are. \n#Person1#: Did you hear about the pilot? \n#Person2#: The one that stole a small plane? \n#Person1#: Yes, he stole a plane in Canada and flew into the U. S. \n#Person2#: Did they catch him? \n#Person1#: Yes. After two U. S. fighter jets followed him for an hour, he landed on a highway. \n#Person2#: Did he crash? \n#Person1#: No, he just landed the plane and walked to a restaurant. \n#Person2#: Did the cops find out why he flew into the U. S. ? \n#Person1#: His life sucked. He was hoping a fighter jet would shoot him down. \n#Person2#: Poor guy. 
#Person1#: Hi, excuse me. is this seat taken?\n#Person2#: Oh, no. It's all yours.\n#Person1#: Thank you very much. My name is Ashlyn. It's nice to meet you.\n#Person2#: Carson. It's nice to mee you, too. \n#Person1#: the weather is so warm for December, don't you think? \n#Person2#: it is unusually warm. I balme it on global warming. \n#Person1#: global warming is wreaking havoc everywhere. \n#Person2#: so sure. Are you from around here? \n#Person1#: no. I'm new here. I just moved here a few months ago. \n#Person2#: where are you from? \n#Person1#: I'm from China. What about you? \n#Person2#: I am from Texas. I was in China once, but it was a long time ago. \n#Person1#: did you enjoy it? \n#Person2#: I did. I especially liked the food. What do you think about the food here? \n#Person1#: it's very different from Chinese food, but I am getting used to it. \n#Person2#: Is that the Da Vinci Code that you've got there? \n#Person1#: yes, have you read it? \n#Person2#: no, but I saw the movie. What do you think about it? \n#Person1#: well, to be honest, I've only gotten though 10 pages of it. So far, though, it's interesting. \n#Person2#: well, this is my stop. it was nice talking with you. \n#Person1#: likewise. Bye! 
#Person1#: excuse me, could you tell me which line I'm supposed to stand in to buy bubble wrap and to post a package? \n#Person2#: you can buy the bubble wrap here, but you'll have to stand in line over here to post your paskage. \n#Person1#: that's a really long line. How long do you think it'll take to get through all those people? \n#Person2#: it takes about 3 minutes per person, so it'll probably be about an hour's wait. \n#Person1#: can I buy stamps here? \n#Person2#: sure. How many would you like? \n#Person1#: I need 30 for my Chrismas cards. \n#Person2#: are you sending them abroad? \n#Person1#: twenty of them are going abroad to China and America. \n#Person2#: do you have any going anywhere in the EU? If you do, those are less expensive. \n#Person1#: no. \n#Person2#: ok, here you go. That will be 18 pounds and seventy two pence. \n#Person1#: and the bubble wrap? \n#Person2#: that's another quid. \n#Person1#: thanks a lot. You've been very helpful. 
#Person1#: Joanne, let's not make this divorce any more acrimonious than it already is, okay? Let's just get down to business and start dividing this stuff up fairly, so we can go our separate ways, alright? \n#Person2#: Fine with me. I just want to get this over with. It's important we make a clean break. I should have signed a pre-nup. \n#Person1#: What was that? \n#Person2#: Nothing! Anyway, you're right, there's no reason this has to be nasty. My lawyer tells me you've accepted our alimony proposal and the division of property, as well as the custody agreement- I keep the cat and you get the dog. So that's done. . . finally. \n#Person1#: Let's not go there, Joanne! Ok, so let's start with the record collection, I'll take the albums I contributed and you can have your cheesy disco albums back. \n#Person2#: Fine, but I'm keeping the antique gramophone as my grandfather gave it to me. \n#Person1#: I believe that was a wedding present to both of us, Joanne. And you hardly ever use it! \n#Person2#: He's my grandfather, and he never really liked you anyway! \n#Person1#: Whatever! Alright, I'll concede the silly gramophone, if you'll agree that I get the silver tea set. \n#Person2#: How typical, when are you ever going to use a silver tea set? Fine! I don't want to drag this out any longer than necessary. What's next? What about these old photographs? \n#Person1#: Which ones? Let me have a look. Wow, look at that! That brings back memories. . . That? \n#Person2#: Our trip to Italy! I remember that day. We were going to visit the Trevi fountain, and we got caught in the rain. . . \n#Person1#: . . . and you looked so adorable with your hair all wet. I had to take a picture of you standing there in that little alley, smiling and laughing in the rain. . . \n#Person2#: Oh, we really did have fun back then, didn't we? \n#Person1#: Oh, Joanne, are we making a big mistake? I know our relationship has been on the rocks for sometime but are you sure we can't reconcile and try again? I still love you. \n#Person2#: Oh Jeff! I love you too! I'm so glad we didn't have to decide who keeps the motorcycle. \n#Person1#: The motorcycle? But that's mine!

#Person1#: Well, mom, thanks for having Simon stay for a couple of days.\n#Person2#: That's OK, Phillip. What have I got to do?\n#Person1#: Well, Saturday's busy. In the morning, he's got his piano class.\n#Person2#: Right. And in the afternoon, he's going to a birthday party, isn't he?\n#Person1#: No, that's in the evening. He's going to the football match in the afternoon. Remember?\n#Person2#: Oh, yes. I remember now. So what time does the party start?\n#Person1#: At 7:30 and Mrs. Carter will bring him home.\n#Person2#: Fine. Now on Sunday morning, we can go to the swimming pool on our bikes.\n#Person1#: Well. He's got a cold, so swimming isn't a very good idea. But he'd like a bicycle ride.\n#Person2#: OK. Your father wants to take Simon to the park in the afternoon.\n#Person1#: Fine. And then a quiet evening watching TV.\n#Person2#: What about a trip to the cinema?\n#Person1#: No, I think he'll be too tired for that.\n#Person2#: OK.
#Person1#: Who are the people in this photo?\n#Person2#: Oh, that's my homestay family. I'm going to Australia for a year on an exchange program. And those are the people I'm living with. Those are the parents, Mr. and Mrs. Smith. Their daughters' names are Jenny and Cindy, and their son's name is George.\n#Person1#: Is that George there?\n#Person2#: No, that's Jenny's husband, Charlie. They were just married. George is the one in front.\n#Person1#: Good looking man, he's not married?\n#Person2#: No. Cindy's not married, either. But Jenny and Charlie are moving to their own house next week. So it won't be as crowded as it looks. I'm leaving for Sydney in a month.\n#Person1#: Well, have a great time.

#Person1#: What's the matter, John? you seemed to be restless today.\n#Person2#: You see, I've been offered a new job. I can't decide whether to take it or not.\n#Person1#: Oh, that's easy. If it's better than the one you are doing now, go for it. That's my advice.\n#Person2#: It isn't that easy. I hate to quit my present job. People around here are very nice and the work itself is challenging.\n#Person1#: Then what about the salary? Would you get more?\n#Person2#: Yes, they say I would get a big sum.\n#Person1#: Have you discussed it with your wife?\n#Person2#: Yes, she leaves it to me.\n#Person1#: As I say it the work is well worth try.

When do you plan to go?\n#Person1#: The sooner the better! I can ' t wait!\n#Person2#: Oh, I don ' t know where we ' re going yet.\n#Person1#: As long as we ' re going, you can decide where to go. I trust your judgments. I know you miss Chinese food, so we can eat at a Chinese restaurant this time.\n#Person2#: Let ' s go to Chicago. We can have lunch in Chinatown. Then we can go to a ball game at Wrigley Field!\n#Person1#: You have such good ideas!

I'm pretty out-going and friendly.\n#Person1#: do you have experience in the IT field?\n#Person2#: I have some. I worked in the IT department at a language school for four years in Spain.\n#Person1#: do you speak Spanish?\n#Person2#: yes, but not fluently.\n#Person1#: that's OK. Have you sent your CV out to anyone yet?\n#Person2#: I've sent my CV to dozens of companies but nobody has got back to me.\n#Person1#: did you write a clear objective in your resume?\n#Person2#: no, because I didn't know what I wanted to do.\n#Person1#: I think you need to update your CV. Bring it over to my office tomorrow and I'll help you with it.\n#Person2#: thanks, I will. I'll see you tomorrow then!
#Person1#: Where did you get all these barney tour pamphlets?\n#Person2#: I took them from a travel agency. Look at those nice pictures, lash forest, palm fringed, white sand beaches, crystal blue ocean, they're breath-taking. It is like paradise on earth.\n#Person1#: That's why it's become a very popular holiday destination these years. Someone told me the service there is very good too. Are you planning to spend the holiday there?\n#Person2#: Yes, I'm thinking about signing up for a tour in the travel agency. Their next tour starts the same time as my holiday does next month.\n#Person1#: How many days is the tour?\n#Person2#: 10 days. When I get back, I still have two days to go before work. Isn't that great?\n#Person1#: That's a perfect plan. Enjoy yourself.
#Person1#: Hello!\n#Person2#: Is Petti there?\n#Person1#: I'm sorry, I'm afraid you've dialed the wrong number. There is no Petti here.\n#Person2#: Wrong number? Are you sure? I called yesterday and she was there.\n#Person1#: I'm sure you have the wrong number. This one has been my number for more than 20 years.\n#Person2#: That's impossible. I remember the number clearly. Isn't this 763-4565?\n#Person1#: No, It isn't. It's 736-4565. It seems you've misdialed.\n#Person2#: Really? I'm so sorry I bothered you. I'll try again.\n#Person1#: That's all right. This sort of thing happens all the time to everyone.\n#Person2#: Yeah. I guess it does. Sorry again for bothering you.\n#Person1#: No worries.
#Person1#: Hello, Alice. Would you like to go to the temple fair with me?\n#Person2#: Temple fair?\n#Person1#: Yes. The ancient custom of holding temple fairs is to offer sacrifices to the god of the earth, and they have developed into a festival filled with food, performances and games now.\n#Person2#: Sounds interesting!\n#Person1#: Absolutely, I love temple fairs. Beijing has several temple fairs recently. They are different from each other to some extent, but also have a lot in common.\n#Person2#: I just can't wait to see them. Which one do you choose today?\n#Person1#: What about Tianqiao Temple Fair? A variety of opera performances, acrobatics shows, and food will dazzle you.\n#Person2#: Great! Do you know how to get there?\n#Person1#: Of course.\n#Person2#: Couldn't be better.
#Person1#: Tomorrow I'll take you to some places that I'm sure you will have interest in.\n#Person2#: Where else haven't we been to yet?\n#Person1#: They are the Folk Antique Handicrafts and Collectibles Exhibition Halls.\n#Person2#: Sounds great! How many kinds of folk collections do they have?\n#Person1#: Well. there're actually over 200 kinds of folk collections in this city. That's half the collections of antique objects in China. There's one exhibition half for multiple collection, and several individual display rooms for private collectors.\n#Person2#: Private collectors! They must have excellent collections. I'II go and see each of them. What kinds of collections can I see? Come on, don't keep me in suspense!\n#Person1#: No hurry! I'II tell you now, The collections include ancient cases and caskets, tea sets, abacuses, precious sea shells and conches, drama costumes, agates, ancient coins, fans, mini-musical instruments, root-carving, rare stones and rocks, model ships, model cars. . .\n#Person2#: Enough! I can't wait anymore.
#Person1#: She is so beautiful, isn't she?\n#Person2#: Who?\n#Person1#: Julia Roberts.\n#Person2#: Yeah, she is so charming. I like her, too.\n#Person1#: It's said that her new movie is going to come out.\n#Person2#: What's the movie about?\n#Person1#: I'm not sure.\n#Person2#: Isn't it silly to see a movie that you know nothing about?\n#Person1#: I already told you, because Julia Roberts is in it. I like her because she is not only a great actor but also is very generous to give a lot to many kinds of charities.\n#Person2#: Yeah, she is great. I also admire her for her concern about society.
#Person1#: Will they send me a form telling me that I have been granted unemployment?\n#Person2#: A Notice of Unemployment Insurance Award letter will be sent to you.\n#Person1#: What information will be in that letter?\n#Person2#: The Award Letter will inform you as to how much you will receive.\n#Person1#: What other forms will I need to turn in?\n#Person2#: Every two weeks you will receive a Continued Claim Form that you must turn in.\n#Person1#: What will they be asking me on that form?\n#Person2#: You must show that you were available and that you looked for work.\n#Person1#: What else will they ask me?\n#Person2#: One of the questions they ask you is if you were well enough to work.
#Person1#: What about a medication to help me with my problem?\n#Person2#: There are several types of medications that we can try for your high blood pressure.\n#Person1#: What types of medications would be best?\n#Person2#: For water retention, I am going to start you on Hydrochlorothiazide, which is a diuretic.\n#Person1#: What are the side effects from taking that drug,\n#Person2#: You need to stay hydrated on this drug, but most people experience little side effects.\n#Person1#: Will that one medication take care of all of my problems?\n#Person2#: For now I want you to take a second drug, Lisinopril, an ACE inhibitor.\n#Person1#: Am I going to experience any complications with that drug?\n#Person2#: The most you will experience will be a dry cough but you probably won't experience anything negative.
#Person1#: Good morning! I am a rookie in our office.\n#Person2#: Good morning! Welcome to our office!\n#Person1#: Nice to meet you! My name is Peter Smith.\n#Person2#: Nice to meet you too! I am George Williams.\n#Person1#: This is my first day at work!\n#Person2#: Well, hope you will enjoy your first day!\n#Person1#: I am new to the work and I will appreciate your guidance!\n#Person2#: I will try my best to assist you if you need any help.\n#Person1#: Thank you. It is very kind of you.\n#Person2#: You are welcome.
#Person1#: How are you doing?\n#Person2#: Everything's fine with me.\n#Person1#: What can I do for you today?\n#Person2#: Is it possible for me to view the apartment today?\n#Person1#: Unfortunately, you will not be able to view it today.\n#Person2#: Why can't I view it today?\n#Person1#: You'll need to make an appointment to view the apartment.\n#Person2#: I understand. May I make an appointment then?\n#Person1#: How does this Friday sound?\n#Person2#: Friday at 6 pm. would be perfect.\n#Person1#: That will be fine.\n#Person2#: Thanks for your help.
#Person1#: I'm glad to have the opportunity of visiting your corporation. I hope to conclude some substantial business with you.\n#Person2#: It's a great pleasure to meet you, Mr. Brown. I believe you have seen our exhibits in the showroom. May I know what particular items you're interested in?\n#Person1#: I'm interested in your hardware. I'Ve seen the exhibits and studied your catalogues. I think some of the items will find a ready market in Canada. Here is a list of my requirements, for which I'd like to have your lowest quotations, C. I. F. Vancouver.\n#Person2#: Thank you for your inquiry. Would you tell us the quantity you require so that we can work out the offers?\n#Person1#: I'll do that. Meanwhile, could you give me an indication of price?\n#Person2#: Here are our F. O. B. price lists. All the prices in the lists are subject to our confirmation.\n#Person1#: What about the commission? From European suppliers I usually get a 3 to 5 percent commission for my imports. It's the general practice.\n#Person2#: As a rule we don't allow any commission. But if the order is a substantial one, we'll consider it.\n#Person1#: You see, but I do business on a commission basis. A commission on your prices would make it easier for me to promote sales. Even two or three percent would help.\n#Person2#: That's something we can discuss later.
#Person1#: Ladies and gentlemen, we are heading towards the first spot of our trip-the Louvre.\n#Person2#: Wonderful. That's a place famous for its arts.\n#Person1#: Yes. There are so many famous paintings on show. I am sure it will be an unforgettable trip.\n#Person2#: Surely it will be. By the way, when will we get there?\n#Person1#: Half an hours later.
#Person1#: Please show me the menu, Miss.\n#Person2#: Of course. Here you are. Can I take your order now?\n#Person1#: Yes. I'd like an Italian soup to start with and then some fried noodles.\n#Person2#: All right. Can I serve you anything else?\n#Person1#: Yes, I'd like another cup of coffee afterwards. Make it hot, please.\n#Person2#: You've got it, sir.
#Person1#: Judy, what do you think of the new general manager?\n#Person2#: He has extensive experience, although the guy's really deep, sometimes, it scares me.\n#Person1#: I heard he's very clear about his likes and dislikes and he's not the type to just let things go, so don't provoke him.\n#Person2#: I know, and that's why I'm always respectful and I keep my distance. It's safer that way.\n#Person1#: Me too, I don't know why, but every time I see the guy, I break into a cold sweat.\n#Person2#: It's in the eyes. They're the type that seems to look into your soul, making one really uneasy.\n#Person1#: Whatever we said, we must be more careful.\n#Person2#: Yes, I agree with you.
#Person1#: Look! Allen has the mike!\n#Person2#: I thought he only liked to listen?\n#Person1#: That was before he heard Stanley sing! I guess he couldn't stand it anymore, so he decided to give it a try himself! Allen has a really good voice! He sounds like Enrique Iglesias!\n#Person2#: And he can move, too! He dances like Ricky Martin!
#Person1#: Don't you have air-conditioning in your apartment? It's sweltering here!\n#Person2#: Well, there is air-conditioning. Did you see that window air conditioner there? The problem is that the window unit isn't powerful enough.\n#Person1#: I guess not, huh.\n#Person2#: Well, I'm going to move out anyway. The new apartment has central air-conditioning.\n#Person1#: You should have moved out long, long ago.\n#Person2#: Well, I had to wait until the lease expired. So. . .\n#Person1#: So how can you stand the heat?\n#Person2#: Well, I open the windows and. . . and I'Ve got an electric fan ere. It helps a little.
#Person1#: We have one day to visit the big city, can you give us some advice?\n#Person2#: Yes, you can take a limo, a tour bus or just walk.\n#Person1#: I don't think we can visit the city in one day just by walking. How much does the limo cost?\n#Person2#: $ 50 a day.
#Person1#: O. K. So, where do you think we can save more money?\n#Person2#: Well, we could eat in more. That $ 300 for entertainment is mostly going to restaurants.\n#Person1#: Yeah, that's a good idea, and you like to cook. What about the books?\n#Person2#: No, I need my books.\n#Person1#: Come on, if we save more money we can retire earlier, and you'll actually have time to read all those books you buy.\n#Person2#: Well, what about the $ 50 you spent on a shirt? You could'Ve gotten something for less.\n#Person1#: O. K. Let's compromise, if you agree to only spend $ 75 on books, I'll agree to only spend $ 40 for my next shirt.\n#Person2#: All right. That sounds fair.
#Person1#: How many hours do you work a week?\n#Person2#: I do a forty-hour week. I'm on flexi-time. I usually start work at 8 a. m. and finish at 4\n#Person1#: And how many weeks holiday do you get a year?\n#Person2#: Four - plus public holidays. I usually take two weeks off in the summer and the rest at New Year.\n#Person1#: Do you do overtime?\n#Person2#: Yes, if we're busy. I'm paid double-time if I work at weekends.
#Person1#: Hello! Is Mr. Green there?\n#Person2#: Speaking. May I ask whom I am talking to?\n#Person1#: This is Li with Silk Company. We met last Sunday during the exhibition.\n#Person2#: Oh, yes. I remember your company.\n#Person1#: Thank you for visiting our products. I remember that you are interested in our silk products and so, could I have a meeting with you this week to show you moreinformation about our products?\n#Person2#: I'd like to, but I'm afraid that my schedule is full this week.\n#Person1#: What about next week? Is it convenient for you?\n#Person2#: Am. How about 10 a. m. on next Friday?\n#Person1#: Any time you say is OK.\n#Person2#: All right, expecting you.
#Person1#: I'm not satisfied with it.\n#Person2#: Why not? What's wrong with it?\n#Person1#: Sometimes it goes fast. And sometimes it goes slow. And the alarm doesn'twork, either.\n#Person2#: Would you like another one?\n#Person1#: No. Can I have my money back?\n#Person2#: Hmm. . . have you got a receipt?\n#Person1#: A receipt?\n#Person2#: Yes. I must see your receipt. You can't have your money back without receipt.\n#Person1#: Oh, I'm not certain, but I think I've lost it.
#Person1#: When can I move into my new house?\n#Person2#: The current owners will be moving out on Tuesday, so technically you could pick up the keys and move in on Wednesday.\n#Person1#: Will the utilities be turned on?\n#Person2#: You need to contact the utility company and make arrangements to transfer the utilities to your name.\n#Person1#: I really want to paint the walls right away and get the carpet cleaned.\n#Person2#: If I were you, I would take a few days to take care of those things before you move in.\n#Person1#: I was thinking that I should have my new appliances delivered as we are moving in.\n#Person2#: That would be perfect. That way, someone will be there, but you will have them right away.\n#Person1#: Can you help me on my move-in day?\n#Person2#: I think that I have something else really important to do on that day. I just can't remember what it is.
#Person1#: Oh, will you tell me when I get Hayfield Road, please?\n#Person2#: It's only three stops from here. I tell you when we get there, it's my stop, too.\n#Person1#: Thank you. That is very kind of you.\n#Person2#: Don't mention it. --Do you see those traffic lights ahead? We'll turn left when we get to them. Hayfield Road is the next stop after that. Why do you want to get off there?\n#Person1#: I want to go to the new Technical College.\n#Person2#: Oh? You won't find it easily if you go down there alone. I show you where it is.\n#Person1#: Thank you very much. But I don't want to put you to any trouble.\n#Person2#: Oh, it is no trouble at all. I have to go past there anyway. We are almost there now. Hurry up, or we will miss the stop. Now, let's get off.\n#Person1#: All right.
#Person1#: Good morning. Miss Zhao. Please sit down.\n#Person2#: Thank you. It's nice to meet you. Mr. Zhang.\n#Person1#: I have your application here. You are a university student?\n#Person2#: Yes. I'm a business major.\n#Person1#: So you are interested in working for our company.\n#Person2#: Yes, I need a part time job, both for money and experience.\n#Person1#: We'll have an opening for an office clerk this summer.\n#Person2#: That would be wonderful.\n#Person1#: Are you computer trained?\n#Person2#: Yes, I can handle Windows, Power Point, and Excel. Here is my certificate.\n#Person1#: Ah. that's very good. You'll need some training in our methods, though. Every office is different, you know.\n#Person2#: Thank you. That will be very helpful for my future. When do I start exactly?\n#Person1#: We'll let you know as soon as possible. Goodbye.\n#Person2#: Goodbye.
#Person1#: Good afternoon. I'd like some information about the trains, please.\n#Person2#: Yes, madam. Which train? Where are you going?\n#Person1#: To Bournemouth. You see, I have a sister there and...\n#Person2#: So your question is 'When's the next train to Bournemouth?' Is that right?\n#Person1#: Yes, that's right.\n#Person2#: At half past four. That's in about a minute.\n#Person1#: Thank you. Oh! Which platform does it leave from?\n#Person2#: Platform 13.\n#Person1#: Platform 13! Oh,dear! I never travel on trains that leave on Platform 13! 13 is an unlucky number. When's the next train after the 4:30?
#Person1#: We are having a debate on advertising Thursday evening, and I have to take part.\n#Person2#: That's interesting. I should like to hear what people think about advertising.\n#Person1#: What's there to say? We must have advertising, mustn't we?\n#Person2#: Why?\n#Person1#: Well, we wouldn't know what there was to buy if we didn't have advertisements.\n#Person2#: Yes, that's true. Up to a point, advertisements provide information that we need. IF someone has produced a new article, naturally, the seller wants to tell us about it.\n#Person1#: Yes, and the advertisements tell us which product is the best.\n#Person2#: Do they? I don't think so. Every manufacture says that his product is the best, or at least tries to give the impression. Only one can be the best, so the others are misleading, aren't they?\n#Person1#: Well, in a way, I suppose, but we don't have to believe them, do we?\n#Person2#: Are you saying that advertisements aren't effective? I don't think that intelligent businessmen will spend millions of dollars on advertising if nobody believes the advertisements, do you?\n#Person1#: Perhaps not, but after all, it's their money that they are spending.\n#Person2#: Is it? I think not. The cost of advertising is added to the price of the article. You and I and all the other people who buy the article pay for the advertising.\n#Person1#: Well, I suppose we get something for our money, some information.\n#Person2#: Yes, but don't forget it is often misleading information, and sometimes harmful.\n#Person1#: Harmful?\n#Person2#: What about the advertisements desiring to persuade young people to smoke cigarettes? Wouldn't you say the are harmful?\n#Person1#: You've given me a lot to think about. I'm quite looking forward to the debate now.
#Person1#: The prevailing attitude about premarital contracting is that it spoils the whole concept of marriage, love, and trust. How do you counter that?\n#Person2#: First of all, most of us hear about premarital contracting when someone rich and famous gets divorced and about all the battles they are going through. I know when my husband and I decided that we wanted to have a premarital contract, my son said 'Why you guys doing that? Don't you trust each other?' So it's not surprising that people's initial reaction is a negative one. But in fact, premarital contracting is a way that we can learn more about each other, make each other feel more comfortable about issues that are of concerns, and certainly clarify money concerns. This way, we can talk about them, decide together how we want our marriage to work, and if necessary, and only if necessary, we put it in a premarital contract, a legal document.\n#Person1#: Each year, there is one divorce for every two marriages. And a substantial portion of those who have divorced remarry. Is the notion of the premarital contract simply for those who are entering second marriages, or is it also something for the people getting married for the first time?\n#Person3#: Premarital contracting is a communication process. I think all of us, whatever age we are, whatever financial status we have, we have things to talk about. And if we avoid doing that and wait until there are problems, it's almost too late. I think that no matter what age, whether we've been married once or not, whether we have stepchildren, whether we have assets, it's important to communicate and consider a legal document.
#Person1#: Excuse me. Can you tell me which is the way to the nearest shoe shop?\n#Person2#: There's one on Queen's Road.\n#Person1#: Thank you, but how can I get there?\n#Person2#: It's not far from here. Walk along this road and after three blocks you'll see a post office on your right. The shop is just behind it.\n#Person1#: How long do you think it will take me to get there?\n#Person2#: About 20 minutes at the most. Anyway, you can take the No.102 Bus.\n#Person1#: I'd better go there by bus. By the way, where is the bus stop, please?\n#Person2#: Just across the road.\n#Person1#: Thanks a lot.
#Person1#: Hi, Bob. I heard about your accident but I didn't think it would be this bad.\n#Person2#: Well, thanks for making me feel better.\n#Person1#: I can hardly recognize you. Tell me what happened.\n#Person2#: I just got back from Africa where I had a terrible accident in a motorcycle race. I broke both my legs when my motor failed and was hit by another motorcycle. I was laid up in a hospital over there for three weeks.\n#Person1#: Three weeks, that's a long time. What did you do while you were in the hospital?\n#Person2#: Well, if you can believe it, I read all about motorcycle racing. I love racing even if it hurts.\n#Person1#: But I'm afraid you don't make it look very funny. You're lucky to be alive.\n#Person2#: That's for sure. I am lucky to be alive.\n#Person1#: How soon can you get well? Did the doctor tell you about it?\n#Person2#: They say I still need to stay in bed for two weeks or so.\n#Person1#: I think you'll get a bit fatter by then. By the way, is there anything I can do for you?\n#Person2#: No, thank you. Thank you for the beautiful flowers. It's very kind of you to come to see me.\n#Person1#: I'll be going then. Bye.\n#Person2#: Bye.
#Person1#: Mark is the best candidate for chairman of the student union, isn't he?\n#Person2#: Well, that guy won't be able to win the election unless he gets some majority vote from women students. And I'm not sure about that.
#Person1#: (Sniffing) Phew! Is that French coffee?\n#Person2#: Pardon?\n#Person1#: Is that French coffee you are drinking?\n#Person2#: Yes,that's right. Why? What's the matter?\n#Person1#: I don't understand why you drink French coffee. It makes a strong smell.\n#Person2#: I like it very much, I prefer it to English coffee.\n#Person1#: Have you got a lot of it?\n#Person2#: Yes. Why?\n#Person1#: Well.., er...could I get some from you?\n#Person2#: Get some from me? But...you don't like French coffee!\n#Person1#: No, I don't, but my wife does and I can't understand why.
#Person1#: So, Emily, how was your day? \n#Person2#: I don't think you really want to hear about it. \n#Person1#: It can't have been that bad. Go on and tell me about it. \n#Person2#: To be honest, it was horrible! My manager is such a pain in the neck! \n#Person1#: Why? What happened? \n#Person2#: Well, he made quite a few mistakes on the monthly report and when his supervisor found them, my manager blamed them on me! \n#Person1#: That's not very fair. What did you do? \n#Person2#: There wasn't really anything that I could do. There's always been a lot of bad blood between my manager and myself. If I had said anything, he would have fired me for sure. \n#Person1#: Does he treat everyone in your department like this? \n#Person2#: He treats everyone pretty badly, but the way he treats me really takes the cake! \n#Person1#: Do you have any idea why he treats you worse than the others? \n#Person2#: I really have no idea. All I know is that the thought of him really curls my hair! \n#Person1#: Is there anyone else you can talk to about it at your company? \n#Person2#: Not really. I'm hoping to live with it for a while until I get a promotion. \n#Person1#: That's very sensible. It sounds like you have a good head on your shoulders. \n#Person2#: I try to be sensible about it, but it's not very easy. Sometimes you just have to grin and bear it. \n#Person1#: That's so true. When you have a taste for success, you can't let dishonest people like your manager get in the way. 
#Person1#: I can put you in rooms three-eleven and three-twelve. They're at the rear of the hotel. \n#Person2#: Mona \n#Person3#: That's much better, thank you. \n#Person2#: Mona \n#Person3#: Yes, Dad? \n#Person2#: I'd like a view. \n#Person3#: Oh. Is there a view? \n#Person1#: Not really. \n#Person3#: Well, we want our rooms together. \n#Person2#: Mona... \n#Person3#: Yes, Dad? \n#Person2#: I don't mind if our rooms aren't together. I'd like a lovely view. \n#Person1#: I'll see what I can do. I can put you both on the same floor. Room 305 with a view and Room 311 at the rear. Your father will be just opposite you, Ms. White. Is that OK? \n#Person3#: Oh, yes, that's fine. \n#Person2#: Thank you. \n#Person1#: My pleasure. Could you just fill out this form please? 
#Person1#: Well, any luck? Did you see Buster anywhere?\n#Person2#: No, I couldn't find him either. I drove all around the neighborhood. I circled our block 3 times, hoping he'll show up. No such luck. I'm sorry, Ben.\n#Person1#: It's not your fault. I shouldn't have left the door open. I hope we'll find him. He is such a huge part of our family. He walks with Lily to school every morning.\n#Person2#: I'm sure we'll find him. Ben, I remember when I lost my dog, Spot. We looked for 10 hours and finally we just gave up. Not long after we got home, Spot showed up at our front door. They know how to get home, Ben. They always do.\n#Person1#: I hope you're right, Lucy. Maybe he'll show up before it gets dark. I just hope he's OK.\n#Person2#: He will be, Ben. He has always been loyal to you and your family. He's probably just off exploring.\n#Person1#: If you say so, let's walk up Forest Avenue and see if maybe he's hiding in Mr. Johnson's yard. He always likes to bark and chase his cat around there.\n#Person2#: That's a good idea. See, we'll find him before you know it. You have nothing to be worried about.
#Person1#: Hello, this is Andrea.\n#Person2#: Hello, Andrea, this is Alex. I have some very good news for you. Miranda was very satisfied with you, and said she's very much looking forward to working with you. Isn't that wonderful? Congratulations, dear. How does it feel to be Miranda's new assistant? I imagine that you're just delighted with this news. So let's see, you can start on Monday, right?\n#Person1#: Emm, well, I don't think I can start Monday. I am visiting my father in Baltimore. And because I don't live in New York, I'll need a couple of days to find a flat and buy some furniture, and move my things from my current apartment.\n#Person2#: Oh, well, then, in that case, I suppose Wednesday would be good. OK, see you then.
#Person1#: Lily, where do you like to eat?\n#Person2#: Well, my favorite restaurant is the Knife and Talk. It's very near the city center. At lunch, it's full of office workers, but I like to go before that, in the middle of the morning. I go there and order big breakfast and take one of their newspapers and just relax for an hour or so. Their pancakes are delicious. They don't have a TV in there, which I love most. They just have some jazz music, very quiet. Nothing too loud. What's your favorite restaurant?\n#Person1#: Well, it's just a very simple restaurant. There are only about 6 tables in there, a couple of waitresses wear ugly pink uniforms. But the food is great, very tasty and cheap too, which is important of course. There are some truck drivers sitting at the counter drinking coffee. And eating sausages every morning. I always have pancakes in the morning, and their fish pie for lunch. That restaurant has been open for many years. They say the actor James Dean eats there, sometimes, but I don't think that's true.
#Person1#: I'd like to rent a bike for a day. How much does it cost?\n#Person2#: It's $20 a day. A day is from 9 o'clock in the morning until 7 o'clock in the evening.\n#Person1#: So if I brought the bike back at 7:30, would I have to pay for an extra day?\n#Person2#: Yes, and there's a deposit to pay as well.

The bus drivers are rude, the buses are never on time, and there are few people around who can help you.\n#Person2#: It's not that bad. You probably just had a bad experience once.\n#Person1#: It wasn't just once. Every single time I take the bus, something bad happens to me or to someone else on the bus.\n#Person2#: We could take the subway, but we'd have to go three stops along one line and then change trains twice.\n#Person1#: Train fares are twice as expensive as the bus fare, too.\n#Person2#: If we don't hurry up, we'll miss the show.

The which? section is very interesting this month. They tested facial cleaners. T\n#Person1#: I like to take the tests that they print in this magazine.\n#Person2#: Which tests do you mean?\n#Person1#: You know. Tests like how jealous are you? and are you a fashion victim?\n#Person2#: Oh, I see. I like to do those tests, too, but I don't take them seriously.\n#Person1#: Of course not, but sometimes the results make you think about yourself and what you do. According to the jealousy test, I'm quite a jealous type of person. Perhaps I need to control my jealousy.\n#Person2#: You're right. It's sometimes hard to tell which pages are advertisement and which ones are articles.
#Person1#: What's the matter with you then? You look miserable.\n#Person2#: It's us.\n#Person1#: What do you mean by us?\n#Person2#: Well, you always say you're busy.\n#Person1#: That's right.\n#Person2#: And you often go back to live with your parents and leave our son in the room by himself.\n#Person1#: I. . . I. . . I miss my parents, also they miss me.\n#Person2#: Oh I remember, I cut terrible calls, and you didn't say anything about it.\n#Person1#: You mean I am groaned a few words?\n#Person2#: Totally not. Perhaps it's about our marriage.
#Person1#: I do feel like a trip to Florida on such a gloomy day in New York, to enjoy the sunshine while lying on the beaches of Florida.\n#Person2#: That's a great idea. It's the best season for tourists in Florida. You can also get a good sun-tan there.\n#Person1#: But if the sunshine is too strong, it might damage the eyes and the skin.\n#Person2#: You can put on your shades. And remember don't make your skin look like a tomato. Or else after that your skin will begin to flake off. You may even wind up with skin cancer.\n#Person1#: I see. Overdoing it will do more harm than good.\n#Person2#: You said it.
#Person1#: I've been thinking about getting my hair cut.\n#Person2#: I thought you were going to let it grow out long.\n#Person1#: I said that, didn't I? But I just don't know what to do with it.\n#Person2#: You're in one of those in-between stages, aren't you.\n#Person1#: Yes, it's not short enough to be wash-and-go and not long enough to do anything fancy.\n#Person2#: Have you thought about wearing a hat?\n#Person1#: Everywhere I go?\n#Person2#: Well, it's one way to get through the in-betweens if you really want to grow it out!

I hope you can have these goods delivered before the end of September. We'd like them to be ready in time for our Christmas sales.\n#Person2#: Christmas doesn't come until the end of the year, does it?\n#Person1#: No. But in the United States, the Christmas season begins about a month before December 25.\n#Person2#: Well, I'm afraid a little bit difficult for us to advanced the time of shipment. Our manufacturers are fully committed at the moment.\n#Person1#: I hope you can try to get them to step up production.\n#Person2#: They are already working three shifts a day to step up production as new orders keep pouring in.\n#Person1#: If that's the case, there's nothing to be done about it.\n#Person2#: I'm sorry.\n#Person1#: What's your last word as to the delivery date then?\n#Person2#: By the middle of October. This is the best we can do.\n#Person1#: All right. I'll take your words at that.\n#Person2#: Good. Let's call it a deal.

Now I get it in my mailbox every month.\n#Person1#: Why don't you just read it online?\n#Person2#: Well, I just love the photos, and sometimes I cut them out and put them up on my wall.\n#Person1#: Huh?\n#Person2#: I have been planning my vacation ever since I got that first magazine. I pick the most interesting photos, cut them out, and put them up on my wall. I look at them and decide where I want to go most.\n#Person1#: Most people just do that on Facebook, you know...\n#Person2#: Well, I just prefer to do it this way.\n#Person1#: So how many photos do you have on your wall?\n#Person2#: About a dozen.\n#Person1#: So have you decided where you will go?\n#Person2#: Oh, yes. I even have my plane ticket.\n#Person1#: I can't wait to hear where it is. Two months of planning and studying photos...okay, so...where are you going?\n#Person2#: To Morocco! I'll be there for a month!\n#Person1#: That sounds great!
#Person1#: How do you usually spend your day, Paul?\n#Person2#: I usually get up at seven. I take a shower and dress and then I have breakfast at seven thirty. I leave the house at eight. I work from nine to five. I have dinner at six thirty, watch television and then go to bed.\n#Person1#: How do you usually spend you weekends?\n#Person2#: In the summer, I usually sit in the park. At other times of the year, I like to do odd jobs around the house or paint. Painting is my hobby.\n#Person1#: What do you do for exercise?\n#Person2#: I play basketball every weekend.
#Person1#: Please take a seat!\n#Person2#: Thank you!\n#Person1#: Now, you're applying for a job as secretary with us. I'd like to ask you some questions. Now, first of all, how many foreign languages can you speak?\n#Person2#: Well, I can speak English quite well. And I also know a little Japanese.\n#Person1#: English and a bit of Japanese. Um, can you type?\n#Person2#: Oh, yes, I can type.\n#Person1#: Uh-huh, and can you use a computer?\n#Person2#: Oh yes. I am very good at computers.\n#Person1#: Apple and PC?\n#Person2#: Both, yes. And I can do word processing and other things as well.\n#Person1#: Right, and um, can you take shorthand?\n#Person2#: Yes, not very fast, but I can.\n#Person1#: OK, fine. And can you drive a car?\n#Person2#: No, I'm afraid I can't.\n#Person1#: Well, that's not very important.
#Person1#: Hello, Kate. Have you been to the new sports center yet?\n#Person2#: Not yet. Where is it?\n#Person1#: On Mill Road, near Stone Street, behind Santa Station.\n#Person2#: What about it?\n#Person1#: It's wonderful. You can do a lot of sports there. I played table tennis last Saturday, and watched a basketball match.\n#Person2#: What about the swimming pool?\n#Person1#: It's very good. Would you like to go there with me next week?\n#Person2#: Good idea. Every day is OK except Monday.\n#Person1#: Well. Why not go there on Saturday? Then we can stay for a long time.\n#Person2#: OK. See you.
#Person1#: Aren't you going to give us a training workshop next week? How are things going on your preparation for the presentation? \n#Person2#: I'm having trouble narrowing down my topic for the training. I want to speak about how to improve our sales technique, but there is so much to say, it's hard to get organized. \n#Person3#: Our training group won't be very large, so you will have more time to focus on more areas. We can cover a lot of ground in an hour and a half, if everyone is participating and paying attention. \n#Person2#: I want to focus on some suggestions about making sales scores, and I was hoping to throw in a few role plays so that people get practise implementing the things I'm going to talk about. Do you think people will go for the role playing? \n#Person1#: I think some people may be a little shy to do role playing in front of class... but if you are enthusiastic about your topic, you can help everyone to feel more at ease and willing to give it a try. 
#Person1#: I think Andy's party will be fun. \n#Person2#: Yeah, I think so. Oh, by the way, I need to ask you something. \n#Person1#: What's that? \n#Person2#: Could I get back the sweater you borrowed? \n#Person1#: Sure. Oh, that reminds me. Could I borrow your black leather boots? \n#Person2#: My boots? Er. . . Sure, ok. 
#Person1#: Do you have a boyfriend? \n#Person2#: Yes. Why? \n#Person1#: Well, I came to know a girl 3 weeks ago and we have so much in common. \n#Person2#: So? \n#Person1#: So I think I may fall in love with her. \n#Person2#: You are attracted to her. That sounds great, but how do you know that it is a crush or it's real love? \n#Person1#: Then what's the difference between having a crush and falling in love? \n#Person2#: That's a big question. Well, if you are in love, maybe you'll take every opportunity to talk to her or telephone her for no reason at all. \n#Person1#: That's what I did. \n#Person2#: And you think about her all the time? \n#Person1#: Yes. \n#Person2#: And maybe you suddenly have new interests. I mean you suddenly begin to do things you used to avoid, ie. You used to sleep in every morning, but because she jogs every morning, then you begin to like jogging. \n#Person1#: That's it. She likes dogs so much now, and I begin to love dogs. \n#Person2#: Oh, congratulations! Sounds like you've found your soul mate. \n#Person1#: Thanks. But I know falling in love is one thing, while staying in love is another. \n#Person2#: Yeah, that's right. If you find this person is more and more important to you and you can totally trust her, then you can stay in love. \n#Person1#: Yeah. Falling in love is so good! \n#Person2#: While staying in love is even better. 
#Person1#: what was your wedding ceremony like, Abigail? \n#Person2#: my husband and I got married in a registry office with just two friends there as witnesses. But then we had three parties to celebrate. \n#Person1#: three parties? That's quite a lot. That must have been expensive! \n#Person2#: well, since my husband and I are from two different countries, and we live in a third country, we decided to have one in each country. It wasn't actually that expensive. \n#Person1#: were your parents upset that they weren't there to see you get married? \n#Person2#: I would have liked them to be there, but they couldn't afford to fly out to see us, and we couldn't afford to fly out to see them, so they understood. \n#Person1#: did your husband's family get to meet your family? \n#Person2#: my husband's parents flew out to meet my family when we got married in my hometown, so that was great. Some people spend ridiculous amounts of money on extravagant wedding receptions, but we agreed t \n#Person1#: that makes sense. Did you go on a honeymoon? \n#Person2#: we waited until our one-year anniversary to go on our honeymoon to Africa. \n#Person1#: you really didn't have a very traditional wedding, did you? \n#Person2#: not at all, but we don't have a very traditional marriage either, so it suited us perfectly! 
#Person1#: I have been having a lot of headaches lately. \n#Person2#: Have you been having these headaches for a long time? \n#Person1#: I have had headaches my whole life, but they have been getting worse lately. \n#Person2#: Have you been under a lot of stress lately? \n#Person1#: I've been under stress, but no more than usual. \n#Person2#: Have you been getting enough sleep lately? \n#Person1#: No, I only sleep a few hours a night. \n#Person2#: Have you had any head injuries lately? \n#Person1#: Yes, actually I fell skiing last week and hit my head. \n#Person2#: I am going to send you for a CT scan, and I will see you again when we see the results. 
#Person1#: Have you bought another handset \n#Person2#: No, it is the original one. \n#Person1#: This is silver gray,while I remember your handset was black. \n#Person2#: I have changed a case for it. \n#Person1#: Can a handset case be changed? \n#Person2#: Of course. That's why I bought this type. I can change its case frequently, so it is novel to use it. \n#Person1#: How many cases are accessible? \n#Person2#: There are two more, one is orange and the other is pink. I have bought them all. \n#Person1#: It's really going to be fresh all the time. 
#Person1#: Mom, I want a puppy.\n#Person2#: Let me think about it.\n#Person1#: Why do you have to think about it?\n#Person2#: Because puppies cost money.\n#Person1#: No, they don't. Puppies are free.\n#Person2#: Yes, but puppies need their shots.\n#Person1#: Shots for what?\n#Person2#: So they won't get sick, just like why you get your shots.\n#Person1#: I hate shots.\n#Person2#: And puppies have to eat. Food costs money.\n#Person1#: No problem. I'll give him some food off my plate.\n#Person2#: Oh, no, you won't. Puppies don't eat vegetables.
#Person1#: Wow, that was a delicious meal! We must come back to this restaurant. Everyone in my family told me how good it was, but I'd never tried it before. I'm glad I listened to them.\n#Person2#: I've been here a lot with my friends, but this time was the best. Last time I ate some pasta and it was OK, but my steak tonight was excellent.\n#Person1#: My chicken was amazing. It was so soft and juicy. It's easy to cook chicken too long until it's dry, but this was perfect.\n#Person2#: We should tell the chef. I'm sure he would appreciate it.
#Person1#: I ' m hungry, let ' s go grab a bite to eat.\n#Person2#: Yeah me too. Oh! Can we stop at the shop really fast? I lost my makeup bag at the airport and I want to pick up a few things.\n#Person1#: Will you take long?\n#Person2#: No! Five minutes I promise!\n#Person1#: Come on! We have been here for almost an hour! I thought you said you were only going to get a few things! How long does it take you to pick out a lipstick and some nail polish!\n#Person2#: Are you crazy? You have no idea what you are talking about! Just for my eyes I have to get eye-liner, an eyelash curler, eye shadow, an eyebrow pencil and mascara. Then I need to get foundation, liquid foundation.\n#Person1#: Whoa whoa whoa! Are you nuts? How much is all this going to cost? I ' m looking at the price at each one of these little things and it ' s outrageous! This is basically a crayon!\n#Person2#: What about you? You spend as much or more money on your razors, after shave, cologne and gel! Not to mention how much you spend on clothes and...\n#Person1#: Fine! Get the stupid thirty dollar crayon!
#Person1#: It was very kind of you to give me a tour of the place. It gave me a good idea of your product range.\n#Person2#: It ' s a pleasure to show our factory to our customers. What ' s your general impression, may I ask?\n#Person1#: Very impressive, indeed, especially the speed of your NW Model.\n#Person2#: That ' s our latest development. A product with high performance. We put it on the market just two months ago.\n#Person1#: The machine gives you an edge over your competitors, I guess.\n#Person2#: Certainly. No one can match us as far as speed is concerned.\n#Person1#: Could you give me some brochures for that machine? And the price if possible.\n#Person2#: Right. Here is our sales catalog and literature.\n#Person1#: Thank you. I think we may be able to work together in the future.
#Person1#: So, Casey, how are things going with the photos for the press kit?\n#Person2#: Yeah, I ' Ve been meaning to talk to you about that. I might need to ask for an extension on that deadline.\n#Person1#: You ' Ve had over a month to get this finalized! Why are things delayed?\n#Person2#: Well, the thing is, we ran into a lot of problems...\n#Person1#: I ' m not looking for excuses here. I just want to get this finished on time!\n#Person2#: I know, and I apologize for the delay. But some things were just beyond my control. I had trouble booking the photographer, and then Michael was sick for three weeks, so I couldn ' t include him in the photos, and the design team lost all the files, so I had to re-do the pictures.\n#Person1#: I ' m not going to put this off any longer, Casey! I want those photos ASAP!
#Person1#: Hi, my name is Ted, what's yours?\n#Person2#: What?\n#Person1#: I said, I'm Ted, who are you?\n#Person2#: Huh? Oh, my name is Laura.\n#Person1#: Do you come here often, Laura?\n#Person2#: Huh? I can't hear you, the music's too loud.\n#Person1#: Let's go outside and talk. So Laura, do you come here often?\n#Person2#: Hold on, my ears are still ringing from the music. . . what was it you asked me?\n#Person1#: I asked if you come here often.\n#Person2#: Sometimes, usually once every few weeks. Do you?\n#Person1#: No, this is my first time here.\n#Person2#: I usually come with a group of friends. We dance a little, have a few drinks, and just have a good time.\n#Person1#: Yeah, that's why I'm here. My friends dragged me here, because they think I spend too much time studying.\n#Person2#: That's good. It's good to hit the books, but you need to get out once in a while.\n#Person1#: I guess so. But the music is too loud. I don't mind getting out and meeting people, but next time I'll do it in a park.
#Person1#: Today is Saturday, isn't it?\n#Person2#: Yes, what's wrong?\n#Person1#: What's the date today?\n#Person2#: Today is September 28th, 2007.\n#Person1#: I have a meeting this afternoon.\n#Person2#: When will it begin?\n#Person1#: It will begin at three o'cock. What's the time now?\n#Person2#: It is half past one.\n#Person1#: I have to go now. I don't want to be late.\n#Person2#: Don't worry, time is enough.
#Person1#: Ladies and gentlemen, dear Mr. Simpson. Following the increasing communication between Unity Company and Pineapple Computer Company, we established steady cooperation. And today we all here feel very proud and honored to have Mr. Simpson with us. Mr. Simpson is well-known for his success and his career. So first of all, let me, on the behalf of all present here, extend our warm welcome and cordial greetings to our distinguished guest. Now let's invite Mr. Simpson to give us his speech.\n#Person2#: I want to show my gratitude for your hospitality. And I believe me trip here will be meaningful and our cooperation will go deeper and stabler in near future. Through the communication, we can know more about each other. Thank you so much for your consideration.\n#Person1#: Well, I also hope our cooperation will be never-ending. Thank you again.
#Person1#: I'm phoning about the factory visit next Friday. What should I do when I arrive?\n#Person2#: Park in the visitors'car park in front of the factory and then go to the gatehouse. It's directly opposite the entrance to the car park. The Security people will sign you in and give you a visitor's badge. My assistant will come down to meet you.\n#Person1#: OK, thanks. Look forward to seeing you on Friday, then.
#Person1#: Yuck. The carrots taste awful and salty. Hi sis, how do you like them?\n#Person2#: I like them very much. They are delicious.\n#Person1#: Well, you can have all my carrots.\n#Person2#: Daniel, hold on for a minute. What are you trying to pull there?\n#Person1#: Nothing. Just that I don't care for these carrots. Hi, sis. , I saw you buy some chocolate cakes. I am done with the main course. It's about time for some dessert.\n#Person2#: Oh, you want my chocolate cakes, so to speak!\n#Person1#: No, no, I'm just thinking of some dessert. And I have had enough carrots.\n#Person2#: Daniel, carrots contain much Vitamin C. It is good for you.\n#Person1#: I know, but chocolate cake is even better.\n#Person2#: Oh, stop it! You know you need vegetables. You will end up fat if you don't watch your diet, now.\n#Person1#: Well, actually, I don't mind eating carrots, but chocolate cakes are much better. You know I was born with a sweet tooth.
#Person1#: David, would you like something to eat?\n#Person2#: No, I'm full.\n#Person1#: Do you want something to drink?\n#Person2#: Yes, I'd like some coffee.\n#Person1#: Sorry, I don't have any coffee.\n#Person2#: That's OK. I'll have a glass of water.\n#Person1#: A small glass, or a big one?\n#Person2#: Small please.\n#Person1#: Here you are.\n#Person2#: Thanks.\n#Person1#: You're welcome.
#Person1#: I'd like to reserve a table for three at 6:30 this evening.\n#Person2#: Let me check. Hold on, please. . . Yes, that's fine. Smoking or nonsmoking area?\n#Person1#: Nonsmoking, please.\n#Person2#: All right. May I have your name?\n#Person1#: My surname is Gao.\n#Person2#: How do you spell it, sir?
#Person1#: I saw an interesting program on TV last night. It was about elderly people.\n#Person2#: And what did the program say?\n#Person1#: It said that people with a positive attitude tend to live longer and happier.\n#Person2#: I think that many physicians now agree with that idea.\n#Person1#: And the TV program also said that physical exercise helps people deal with stress.\n#Person2#: And the most active older people seem to enjoy some kind of physical exercise. My father is over 60 years old, and he lifts weights every day.
#Person1#: Hello there! Come on in! Don't just stand there! Come and take a seat!\n#Person2#: Um, okay. Well, I just want a trim. Nothing too fancy.\n#Person1#: Oh my gosh! Your hair is amazing! So silky, so shiny! I am going to work my magic on your hair! You hear me? You are going to look like a million bucks!\n#Person2#: Okay. Um. . . can you make sure my sideburns are even and you just take a little off the top.\n#Person1#: Don't you worry, I'll take care of everything! Oh my god! I just love your curly hair! It's so fluffy and cute! You should totally let it grow out. An afro would look great on you!\n#Person2#: Um. . . no.\n#Person1#: Okay, but you are going to be my masterpiece!
#Person1#: How's the food?\n#Person2#: It's pretty good.\n#Person1#: Well I don't think so. I don't like it at all!\n#Person2#: I'm afraid you're being too particular about your food.\n#Person1#: I eat dog food when my parents are out.\n#Person2#: We're in the same boat! I'Ve eaten fast food the whole week. I hate it now.\n#Person1#: Poor us! All this junk food lacks nutrition!\n#Person2#: Let's dine out tonight for a change!\n#Person1#: Good idea!
#Person1#: I found a great school for Junior!\n#Person2#: Don't you think it's a little early to be looking for schools? We haven't even had the baby yet!\n#Person1#: We can't be too cautious about these things.\n#Person2#: You are going to be such an adorable father! Tell me about this school.\n#Person1#: There is a huge slide on the playground and lots of trees and even a little brook!\n#Person2#: What about inside the school?\n#Person1#: There is a library right inside the front door.\n#Person2#: I think our child is going to love it!
#Person1#: Farmington? Would you take a look at these catalogue ads that Roger did? I don't think we can use them.\n#Person2#: Hmm. I see what you mean. Have you spoken with Roger? He usually does better work than this.\n#Person1#: I know, Mr. Farmington. But, I'm not sure that I should bring this up with him. I think it would be better if you spoke to him.\n#Person2#: All right. Leave these ads with me. I'll speak to him this morning.
#Person1#: Tomorrow is Halloween, I know I'm ready. I bought two pumpkins and a big bags of candy. Do you want to help me a jack-o-lantern?\n#Person2#: I'd love to. I heard about Halloween when I was in Beijing. It's kind of a children's day. Small kids get dressed up, then walk around with paper bags or baskets, knocking on the neighbor's\n#Person1#: They are supposed to say trick or treat? Then the neighbors are supposed to hand up the candy.\n#Person2#: That's kind of cool. But what's the trick mean?\n#Person1#: Usually it's the older kids going around playing Halloween, like punching the pumpkins left outside people's doors or - - someone's tree. They usually do it late at night after little kids go\n#Person2#: That sounds kind of fun, maybe I can get tighter with my friends that night.\n#Person1#: Usually be adults, you don't have kids have a big party in get dressed up too.\n#Person2#: That does sound a lot of fun.
#Person1#: Dear fellows. As you know, Mr. Ross will be leaving us very soon after his short but meaningful visit to our company.\n#Person2#: I really want to stay a little longer, but I still have a meeting to attend. All in all, I am so impressed by your hospitality and your warm welcome. Thank you for the trouble you have taken.\n#Person1#: Just as what I said in my welcome speech, Mr. Ross's visit to our company is meaningful for both our two companies. Thank you very much for your visiting. We will miss you all the time.\n#Person2#: During my trip here, I learned a lot and I get to know our choice of choosing your company as our partner is definitely right. I can feel and sense the potential of your company. And at last I wish our further cooperation will be sound and successful.\n#Person1#: That's our pleasure. Mr. Ross, your visit leaves gorgeous memory here. And I hope Mr. Halmiton, the president of your company can also have the chance to visit our company soon. Remember me to him, please.\n#Person2#: Of course, I will.
#Person1#: Room service. Can I help you?\n#Person2#: This is room 1019. I would like to order breakfast.\n#Person1#: What would you like, sir?\n#Person2#: One orange juice, scrambled eggs with bacon, toast and coffee.\n#Person1#: It will take about 20 minutes, sir. Is that all right?\n#Person2#: Yes, it is. Oh, by the way, could you also bring me today's paper?\n#Person1#: Of course, sir.
#Person1#: Good morning, Mr. Croft.\n#Person2#: Good morning, nurse. I want to see the dentist, please.\n#Person1#: Do you have an appointment?\n#Person2#: No, I don't.\n#Person1#: Is it urgent?\n#Person2#: Yes, it is. It's very urgent. I feel awful. I have a terrible toothache.\n#Person1#: Can you come at 10 am on Monday, April 24th?\n#Person2#: I must see the dentist now, nurse.\n#Person1#: The dentist is very busy at the moment. Can you come at 2 PM?\n#Person2#: That's very late. Can the dentist see me now?\n#Person1#: I'm afraid that he can't, Mr. Croft. Can't you wait till this afternoon?\n#Person2#: I can wait, but my toothache can't!
#Person1#: Hello. Do you like this jewelry? I made most of these items myself.\n#Person2#: You really have talent. How did you learn to do this?\n#Person1#: My mother taught me some tricks of the trade. I've always loved jewelry.\n#Person2#: Me, too. But I could never make bracelets like these.\n#Person1#: I've been making these designs for over ten years. You can have a bracelet for ten dollars.\n#Person2#: I'll take one right now for seven dollars.\n#Person1#: It's a deal!
#Person1#: I've just visited your showroom. You surely get a lot of fancy bedsheets. I like them very much.\n#Person2#: I'm glad you like them. They are all made of silk. Here on display are all the most popular and favorite products. What items are you particularly interested in?\n#Person1#: 20 is very colorful and feels nice. I'd like to start with it. Is it pure silk?\n#Person2#: Yes. It is the latest product and is highly recommended because of its fine design and quality. You certainly have an eye for good things.\n#Person1#: Thank you for saying that. But what's the unit price?\n#Person2#: Here is the catalogue and the price list. You can take a look.\n#Person1#: The price seems acceptable. Can you supply the bedsheets now if we order some?\n#Person2#: No problem.\n#Person1#: That's fine. Then let's sign a contract.
#Person1#: Hey, you. Can't you be a bit faster? You make the whole group wait for you.\n#Person2#: How can you blame it on me? I'm having trouble in operating this kind of machine. It is designed for you right handers.\n#Person1#: You always complain about these machines. But you are not the only one using your left hand.\n#Person2#: Really? I don't know any others who are the same as me.\n#Person1#: To tell you the truth, I'm also left-handed.\n#Person2#: You?\n#Person1#: Yeah. You should spend some time getting suited to it in advance. Then you can do it quickly.\n#Person2#: Is that what you have done?\n#Person1#: Yes. In fact, it pays to use both hands.\n#Person2#: OK, I will try.
#Person1#: I'm not sure about this soup, Carl. It has no taste.\n#Person2#: No! I don't think so, Maria. It tastes fine to me. We've been to this place before, and I don't feel the soup tastes any different.\n#Person1#: Well, I still think it needs something. Salt?\n#Person2#: No, certainly not. What about pepper? If anything, I think it could use a little more of that.\n#Person1#: Now you're talking. That's exactly what it needs. And how about some more onions too?\n#Person2#: I don't know about that. You seem to be starting to like food with strong tastes recently.\n#Person1#: Oh, really?
#Person1#: Why, Ann, I haven't seen you for ages. How have you been?\n#Person2#: Bob, it has been a long time, hasn't it? It must be at least a year.\n#Person1#: No. We talked at the Johnson's Christmas party last December. Don't you remember?\n#Person2#: That's right. Well, how are you? Still working for the Germen company?\n#Person1#: No. I changed my job about 4 months ago. I'm with the World Bank now. How about you?\n#Person2#: I'm still working at the University, but I transferred from the German Department to the Spanish Department.\n#Person1#: Don't you tell me you speak Spanish, too?\n#Person2#: Sure. I grew up in Spain, you know. German was what I studied in college.\n#Person1#: All I have ever managed to learn is a little Italian.\n#Person2#: Oh. excuse me, someone is knocking at the door. I'll talk to you again later, Bob.\n#Person1#: It was nice talking to you, Ann.
#Person1#: Good morning, Miss. I'd like to speak to the manager.\n#Person2#: I am the manager, Sir. How can I help you?\n#Person1#: Oh, really? It's this radio. It doesn't work.\n#Person2#: Mm... did you buy it here?\n#Person1#: What do you mean? Of course I bought it here. Look, you switch it on and nothing happens.\n#Person2#: Could I see your receipt?\n#Person1#: Receipt? I haven't got one.\n#Person2#: Oh, you should have got a receipt when you bought it.\n#Person1#: I perhaps did. I must have thrown it away.\n#Person2#: Ah, well, have you got any other proof of purchase, the guarantee, for example?\n#Person1#: No. It must have been in the box. I threw that away, too.\n#Person2#: Oh, dear. You really ought to have kept it. We need to know the exact date of purchase.\n#Person1#: What? I only bought it yesterday! That young man over there served me. Oh, I paid by cheque. I've got the cheque stub.\n#Person2#: That's all right then. Did you check the radio before you left the shop?\n#Person1#: Check it? No, it was in the box. I hoped it would work. It wasn't a cheap radio. It's a good make.\n#Person2#: You should have checked it.\n#Person1#: Come on! Do not tell me what I should have done, and do something! Either give me my money back or give me another raido.\n#Person2#: There's no need to get aggressive, Sir. Let me look at it... mm... you see this little switch on the back?\n#Person1#: Yes?\n#Person2#: It's on 'main', and it should be on 'battery'. You really should have read the instructions.\n#Person1#: Oh!
#Person1#: What's your favourite game?\n#Person2#: I like to play table tennis. How about you?\n#Person1#: I like swimming and skating.\n#Person2#: Isn't it hard to learn skating?\n#Person1#: No, what you need is balance.\n#Person2#: Could you teach me how to do it?\n#Person1#: Sure, anytime when you are free.\n#Person2#: Do I have to buy a pair of skates?\n#Person1#: I don't think it's necessary. Why not rent them?
#Person1#: I've just had my lunch at the cafeteria of our university.\n#Person2#: What do you think of the food today?\n#Person1#: You have to ask. About as terrible as usual, I'd say.\n#Person2#: You know, I think it's about time a group of us speak to some University officials about the quality of the food.\n#Person1#: Do you have a good idea?\n#Person2#: In my view, we had better get rid of the manager.\n#Person1#: Do you think you are the first to think of that? The problem is that the University doesn't want to change another manager.\n#Person2#: You mean you've been through this before?\n#Person1#: Yes, when I was a freshman, I once did that. I once wrote a letter to the Student Services Official and presented a petition signed by 200 students.\n#Person2#: What was his reaction?\n#Person1#: He asked me why all the other students didn't sign it as well. I told him we only had time for a sample, but I was sure almost all the students would have.\n#Person2#: Why was he so cool towards you? Isn't it a serious question?\n#Person1#: That manager has good friends in the University. You know family connections.
#Person1#: Oh, my! I can't go on.\n#Person2#: Me neither. I give up or I will die.\n#Person1#: I've never seen such hot weather in my life.\n#Person2#: I can't agree more. It's like the whole world is boiling.\n#Person1#: Look. the temperature has hit 98!\n#Person2#: I can't believe it. We used to have such nice weather here all year round.\n#Person1#: Yes. How I miss the good old days. Just cool or warm days.\n#Person2#: So, what to do now?\n#Person1#: I guess we can't do anything until the sun sets down.\n#Person2#: You are right. I'm sweating all over.\n#Person1#: Let's go back home and take a shower.\n#Person2#: Yes. We might cool down in this way.
#Person1#: Why weren't you at the German class last night, Tom? Have you given up?\n#Person2#: Well, no...I came back late yesterday and found John sleeping in the chair. He'd been writing a report all day long and he was too tired to go out again, so we gave the lesson a miss.\n#Person1#: You've missed quite a lot of lessons lately, haven't you? Are you losing interest?\n#Person2#: Yes, I'm afraid so. Neither John nor I have a gift for language. People just laugh at us when we attempt to speak German. How did you and Jane pick it up so quickly and easily? You've hardly been in Germany a month.\n#Person1#: It was neither quick nor easy. We'd both studied the language before we came, and we only needed to revise it.\n#Person2#: Anyway, all our friends here speak English very well, so we don't really need to learn German.
#Person1#: Hey, Mary! You have really been gone a long time. How did you do that?\n#Person2#: Hi! Well, I talked with my teachers before I left about the work I would miss. Besides, my aunt in Denver made me study a lot there.\n#Person1#: I thought she was your rich aunt.\n#Person2#: Not very. But she didn't have any children to raise, so she does have some money, even though she was a teacher.\n#Person1#: How was the holiday?\n#Person2#: Cold, at least three of the days I went. And I saw so many people on the mountain on Washington's Birthday.\n#Person1#: The beaches here were full on Washington's Birthday, too. It really was warm here, so lots of people went swimming.\n#Person2#: Well, we should have stayed home that day. There were so many people. We took the train over to the mountain, so at least we didn't have to drive. It is a good thing we did-there were so many cars and buses, and no place to park anywhere.\n#Person1#: Just like the beaches here.
#Person1#: I really can't stand the way David controls the conversation all the time. If he's going to be at the Christmas party, I just won't come.\n#Person2#: I'm sorry you feel that way. But my mother insists that he come.
#Person1#: Are you going to Helen's birthday party on Friday evening?\n#Person2#: I wouldn't miss it for the world! It's sure to be fun. She's invited a lot of friends. Do you think everyone will be able to get into her house?\n#Person1#: If everyone turned up, it would be very crowded. But a few said that they couldn't go, so I think it should be OK.\n#Person2#: Are you taking anything?\n#Person1#: I've got her a birthday present and I'll take a bottle of wine too.\n#Person2#: That's a good idea. She has bought plenty of food and drinks. It's going to be a noisy party. I hope her neighbours don't mind too much.\n#Person1#: Helen gets on very well with her neighbours. I wouldn't be surprised if they went to the party too.
#Person1#: Welcome to McDonald's. Can I take your order? \n#Person2#: Please give me this extra value meal, a red bean pie, and one order of vegetable salad. \n#Person1#: Would you like something to drink? \n#Person2#: A cup of hot orange juice. \n#Person1#: Will that be it? \n#Person2#: Yes, that's all. 
#Person1#: Waiter, I would like to order now. \n#Person2#: Sure. What do you want to have today? \n#Person1#: Cream soup and steak, please. \n#Person2#: How do you like your steak? \n#Person1#: Excuse me, what does that mean? \n#Person2#: Well, there are several kinds of steaks. For example, you can have your steaks medium-rare, medium-well or well-done. \n#Person1#: Thanks for your explanation, I would like it well-done. 
#Person1#: Well, this is not quite the style I want. Have you any suit in fashion? \n#Person2#: How is this one? It's the latest, made of cashmere. \n#Person1#: Can I try it on? \n#Person2#: Sure. \n#Person1#: This is much better. How much is it? 
#Person1#: Steven! Good to see you brother! How are you? How was your trip? \n#Person2#: It was fine. I've been better but, it's great to be home, I've missed you all! How's mom? \n#Person1#: She's great! All she ever does is talk about you-her little boy that went to the United States. You're her pride and joy, you know that? \n#Person2#: Can't wait to see her. And you? What's new with you? \n#Person1#: Well, Nisha and I are expecting! You'll have another nephew or niece soon! \n#Person2#: That's great! Wow! Congrats! You two are great together, ya know. You have such a beautiful family. I hope one day I can have that. \n#Person1#: Of course, man! Come on! I mean, everything was set here for you to marry Shalini! You know, she's still pining after you. I don't think she'll ever get over you. \n#Person2#: What are you talking about? I hardly knew her! How could she be in love with me? I couldn't go through with it even though she is a great woman. No, I left my heart in the United States. I just hope Veronica is happy. \n#Person1#: Get over it! You're home now. Everyone here thinks so highly of you, there'll be girls throwing themselves at you. You can marry anyone you want! \n#Person2#: I don't want to marry anyone! I want to marry her! Don't you understand? \n#Person1#: You are incorrigible. \n#Person3#: Steven! My baby how are you! I've missed you so much! \n#Person2#: Hey, mom! Great to see you! \n#Person3#: You look so thin! Didn't those Americans feed you? Come come, let's have some chai. By the way. . . There is a girl here waiting for you. \n#Person4#: Hi Steven. \n#Person2#: Veronica! How did you get here? How did you know where I live? I waited for you at the airport but you never showed. . . \n#Person4#: I also have some little secrets that I haven't told you about, but we can discuss that later. I realized that I was just scared. Scared of how much I love you and of the commitment that marriage requires. I'm here now. Now there is something I wanna ask you. Steven, will you marry me? \n#Person5#: I now declare you, husband and wife. You may kiss the bride. 
#Person1#: I heard a rumor this morning. . . It seems Trusten Tools is going out of business. Another competitor is going bankrupt. That could be good news for us. \n#Person2#: I think you must have heard wrong. The truth is we are going to be taken over by Trusten. We are being bought out, and our company will be merging with our largest competitor. It's not good news at all. . . \n#Person1#: What? We are merging with Trusten? I never thought that would happen. Will we be getting new owners? Will it affect our jobs? \n#Person2#: Probably. The new owners will be coming to start alignment meetings nextweek. One of the big question is what to call the new conglomerate company. \n#Person1#: Wow, with such a big change. We won't have the same name? \n#Person2#: It's not only the name of our company that will change. . . I expect that after this acquisition, there'll be a ton of things up in the air. 
#Person1#: I heard that janet has got a new job. She's working for the united investment group. I hear that they pay very well. \n#Person2#: I heard that too. She must be making a pocket. Well, good for her. \n#Person1#: now, she'll be able to save up for that holiday in the united states. \n#Person2#: yes, she will. At the moment, the exchange rate is very favorable, so she should try to go as soon as possible, while it's cheaper. \n#Person1#: you're right. By the way, did you hear that tom inherited some money recently? \n#Person2#: really? I thought his parents had died several years ago. \n#Person1#: they did. He inherited the money form an uncle. I hope he doesn't lose a lot of it in taxed to the government. \n#Person2#: dying can be very expensive nowadays! What's he going to do with it? \n#Person1#: he said that he would probably invest most of it. He's got a well-paid job, so he doesn't need the money to cover day-to day expenses. He just wants some extra money available for when he retires. \n#Person2#: I had some good financial news yesterday too. \n#Person1#: really? Have you won a fortune in the lottery? \n#Person2#: no, but I got a pay rise of 5% and a hours for all the hard work I've put in recently. I think it was very nice for my boss to show his appreciation in that way. \n#Person1#: It certainly was! So, what are you going to do with your windfall? 
#Person1#: Are you really dating with Frank? \n#Person2#: Yeah. But in my heart of hearts, I find he's not very much to my liking. \n#Person1#: Then why not keep away from him? \n#Person2#: The problem is that I just have no one to turn to right now. \n#Person1#: That's stupid. 
#Person1#: Tomorrow will be my first day at work, what do you think I should be wearing? \n#Person2#: Well, if you want to look professional, serious and more conservative, a blue dress, white shirt and not-too-high shoes would be the best choice. But sometimes, very formal clothes will keep you at a distance from your colleagues. It depends on the company's dress code. \n#Person1#: Indeed, I found most of the employees dress casually when I went to the interview. Only the manager was in suit and tie and he just came back from a ceremony. It seems that their dress code is not that formal. Probably, I should put on car key and simple shirt. \n#Person2#: Whatever you choose, make sure they are neat and clean. 
#Person1#: How many laguages can you speak? \n#Person2#: I can speak French and German. \n#Person1#: How well can you speak them? \n#Person2#: I can speak German quite well, but I can't speak French very well. \n#Person1#: Can you help me to translate these sentences into German now? \n#Person2#: No, but I'll be able to tomorrow. 
#Person1#: May, look, what's that in the cage? \n#Person2#: Don't you know that? It's panda. \n#Person1#: Of course I know. I just can't see it very well. \n#Person2#: OK, then put on your glasses, and do you know what does the panda eat? \n#Person1#: Of course, Bamboo! \n#Person2#: That's right. \n#Person1#: I also know they are given to other countries as gifts for friendship. \n#Person2#: You sound quite knowledgeable. \n#Person1#: Not really, panda is my favorite animal. \n#Person2#: Actually, it likes milk too. \n#Person1#: Any way, in a word, panda is our friend. \n#Person2#: Do you know other famous animals in the world? \n#Person1#: Yeah, let me think, the kangaroo and koala bear from Australia are very famous. \n#Person2#: That's right. OK, let's move on. 
#Person1#: Hi, the lab said that you would be getting my test results in today. \n#Person2#: I like you to come in and discuss some further tests that I would like to run. \n#Person1#: I think that this is a bad sign. \n#Person2#: For now, I would like to run a few more tests to look into some of the problems that you mentioned. \n#Person1#: Why wouldn't you tell me over the phone? \n#Person2#: If there is any question about test results, we always do a recheck. \n#Person1#: I need to come in right away. \n#Person2#: I would be happy to see you this afternoon. If you are feeling upset, please bring a friend or relative along. \n#Person1#: You are scaring me! \n#Person2#: Come on in this afternoon and we will talk. It will be fine! 
#Person1#: Are you still learning Chinese?\n#Person2#: Yes. But I don't have enough time for it. I have so many other things to do every day.\n#Person1#: It is the same with me. I can read Chinese now. But I still find it difficult to speak Chinese and I don't always understand people when they speak Chinese to me.\n#Person2#: We don't hear Chinese enough, I think. Do you listen to the radio from China?\n#Person1#: Yes, I listen to the news from China almost everyday. That helps me understand Chinese, but not to speak it.\n#Person2#: We'd better go to China for a holiday.\n#Person1#: Right. That'll be the best way.
#Person1#: Can you tell me where the book A dream of red mansion is?\n#Person2#: I'm sorry it's been lent out. What about this one? It's a newly published novel written by a young writer. It has a fast paced plot and the language is easy to read.\n#Person1#: OK. I'll take it. By the way, how long can I keep it?\n#Person2#: 3 weeks. You can come back and borrow it for longer if you can't finish it in time.\n#Person1#: How long can I keep the novel the second time?\n#Person2#: The same. 3 weeks. But you can only borrow it twice within a year.\n#Person1#: Alright. Thank you very much.
#Person1#: Thanks for agreeing to this interview, Miss Lerner. OK, so I have a few questions. First, when did you know you wanted to write children's books?\n#Person2#: Well, I studied creative writing in college, but after I graduated I worked in advertising. It wasn't until I had my own children that I got interested in children's books.\n#Person1#: Did you write one for your kids?\n#Person2#: Yes, I did. My best friend drew the pictures for me.\n#Person1#: And did they like it?\n#Person2#: They loved it. A friend of my husband saw a copy in our home and he showed it to a publisher that he knew. They published it that year. The next year, I wrote 3 more books. Since the beginning, I have had a total of 8 published.\n#Person1#: That's wonderful. Thank you so much for your time. This interview will appear in my school newspaper in about 3 weeks. I can send you a copy if you'd like.
#Person1#: May I come in?\n#Person2#: Yes, please.\n#Person1#: How are you doing, Madam? My name is During Wu. I am coming to your company for an interview as requested.\n#Person2#: Fine, thank you for coming. Mr. Wu, Please take a seat. I am Anne Smith, the assistant manager.\n#Person1#: Nice to see you, Mrs. Smith.\n#Person2#: Nice to meet you, too.
#Person1#: Hi, Mark! Long time no see!\n#Person2#: Hi, Alex!\n#Person1#: Where have you been?\n#Person2#: I just got back from London.\n#Person1#: How was your flight?\n#Person2#: It was OK. There was a lot of turbulence, though.\n#Person1#: That ' s too bad. how long was the flight?\n#Person2#: It was 10 hours.\n#Person1#: Did you have a layover?\n#Person2#: Yes, in paris, France.\n#Person1#: Did you buy anything in the duty-free stores?\n#Person2#: Yes. I bought two boxed of chocolate? one for me and one for you!\n#Person1#: Oh, you didn ' t have to...\n#Person2#: It was nothing.
#Person1#: You get your bus pass?\n#Person2#: I'm not going to buy one.\n#Person1#: You're not?\n#Person2#: I think it's a waste of money.\n#Person1#: It actually costs less if you have a bus pass.\n#Person2#: How is that?\n#Person1#: You can use it however many times you need to.\n#Person2#: Is that right?\n#Person1#: Yup, and you can keep the money in your pocket.\n#Person2#: That sounds nice.\n#Person1#: You should go get yours.\n#Person2#: Yeah, I think I will.
#Person1#: Hello! This is Ruby speaking from G. O. T. International Travel Agency. What can I do for you?\n#Person2#: I ' d like to make a reservation for my trip from Detroit to Beijing on April 13 on Trans Pacific Airline.\n#Person1#: Do you want a single ticket or a round trip ticket?\n#Person2#: I ' d like to have a round trip ticket with a one-year open return.\n#Person1#: Economy or Business Class?\n#Person2#: Economy, please. How much is it?\n#Person1#: It will be $ 850.\n#Person2#: Very good. Could I get an electronic ticket? I ' m always afraid of losing my tickets.\n#Person1#: No problem. How do you wish to pay for it?\n#Person2#: Bank of American card. The number is 6786 9182 12300 8657.\n#Person1#: Thank you! Would you like an aisle seat or a window seat?\n#Person2#: An aisle seat, please. I ' m tall and need to get up and walk pretty often.\n#Person1#: No problem. Your ticket is for Trans Pacific Flight 87 from Detroit to Beijing at 3 forty p. m. on April 13. You will arrive at Beijing International Airport at six 35 p. m. on April 14. Your electronic\n#Person2#: What time should I arrive at Detroit Airport?\n#Person1#: Please be at the airport two hours before your departure to check in. You also need to reconfirm your reservation with the airline at least 7 days prior to your departure.\n#Person2#: What happens if I can ' t leave on April 13? Can I cancel my ticket or change the reservation to another date?\n#Person1#: Yes, you can, but you will have to pay a penalty of $ 75 for any change or cancellation.\n#Person2#: That ' s OK. What are the weight restrictions for checked baggage?\n#Person1#: On Trans Pacific international flights, each ticketed passenger is permitted a maximum of two checked bags with a maximum weight per checked bag of 70 pounds.\n#Person2#: That ' s great! I can have two bags checked for 70 pounds each. I think I ' m all set. You ' re really efficient. Thank you very much for your help.\n#Person1#: Thank you for the compliment and for calling G. O. T. Travel Agency. Have a nice trip!
#Person1#: What happened? Why didn't he win?\n#Person2#: Didn't you hear? He was disqualified.\n#Person1#: How did that happen? He's so talented! I thought he had a great chance of winning a gold medal!\n#Person2#: If he didn't have any drug problems, he would have won.\n#Person1#: What? What kind of drugs was he using?\n#Person2#: He was taking steroids to make him stronger and faster.\n#Person1#: I thought that all athletes were supposed to be regularly tested for drugs.\n#Person2#: They are. The only reason they didn't disqualify him until after the race is because the results from the text only came back afterwards.\n#Person1#: That's so disappointing. I don't know why top athletes would feel the need to take drugs.\n#Person2#: I don't think it's right, but I can understand why they might. Imagine how much pressure there would be to win for your country!\n#Person1#: Regardless of how much pressure you're under, there's never a good reason to take drugs.\n#Person2#: I agree. Hopefully with the new regulations, fewer athletes will try to cheat with drugs.\n#Person1#: Let's hope so.
#Person1#: Frank ' s getting married, do you believe this?\n#Person2#: Is he really?\n#Person1#: Yes, he is. He loves the girl very much.\n#Person2#: Who is he marring?\n#Person1#: A girl he met on holiday in Spain, I think.\n#Person2#: Have they set a date for the wedding?\n#Person1#: Not yet.
#Person1#: My dear, it's five flights up!\n#Person2#: That's all right. We'll get used to it. Besides, it is quiet up there. We're little further away from the street and traffic noise and there's no one living over us.\n#Person1#: Is the place well-furnished?\n#Person2#: Yes, it's pretty bright in there and big enough for our children to play.\n#Person1#: What about the kitchen?\n#Person2#: The stove and refrigerator are in good working order, and I don't see any loose electric wiring that could cause fires.\n#Person1#: Are the plumbing all right?\n#Person2#: The plumbing seems OK, too. The toilet flushes and the shower has hot and cold water, and the sinks don't seem to leak.\n#Person1#: The place is OK. Let's go there and have a look at it again.
#Person1#: Good evening.\n#Person2#: Good evening. Could you let us have a double room?\n#Person1#: How long will you be staying?\n#Person2#: A week or ten days. We'd like to have a quiet room, if possible-not too near the street.\n#Person1#: Let me see. Yes, you can have Room 313. It's at the back.\n#Person2#: What's the price per day'? And are the meals included or extra?\n#Person1#: 20 pounds per day, including breakfast.\n#Person2#: All right, we'll take it.\n#Person1#: Very good, sir. Will you register, please?\n#Person2#: OK.\n#Person1#: Thank you. The porter will show you to your room
#Person1#: Hello, may I speak to Alice please?\n#Person2#: This is she. How's it going?\n#Person1#: I've been trying to call you all day.\n#Person2#: Sorry about that. I was cleaning up.\n#Person1#: It's okay.\n#Person2#: So what were you calling me about?\n#Person1#: Oh, I just wanted to see if you wanted to hang out tomorrow.\n#Person2#: Sure, what did you want to do?\n#Person1#: Maybe we can go see a movie or something.\n#Person2#: That sounds like fun. Let's do it.\n#Person1#: I'll see you tomorrow then.\n#Person2#: See you then. Goodbye.
#Person1#: Well, I'Ve looked over your resume, Mr. Peepers.\n#Person2#: Please, call me Ted.\n#Person1#: Well, Ted, this is a very impressive resume. However, we do have several other applicants to finish interviewing before we can make a final decision. We'll call you by Friday, if that's all right.\n#Person2#: That's no problem.\n#Person1#: Do you have any other questions?\n#Person2#: Well, what kind of salary do you provide?\n#Person1#: Salary is based on experience as well as time spent with our company.\n#Person2#: I see.\n#Person1#: Salary can be negotiated once we officially offer you the job.\n#Person2#: Sounds fine.
#Person1#: What are you doing over the weekend?\n#Person2#: I'm planing to go bolling tonight. Tomorrow I was hoping to see a movie. What about you?\n#Person1#: I want to go camping, you know, just get a way for the weekend. I'm not sure I'll be able to, though.\n#Person2#: Why not?\n#Person1#: Well, I have a lot of work. I'll see how to goes.
#Person1#: What courses are you going to take next year?\n#Person2#: Well, I am certainly going to take chemistry and physics, but I haven't decided on the other subjects yet. I'd like to take English.\n#Person1#: Why are you going to take english with chemistry and physics?\n#Person2#: Because I want to study english literature. but I think chemistry is better for getting a job.\n#Person1#: Of course it depends on what you are going to do when you leave college. Have you beside what you are going to do when you graduated?\n#Person2#: I am going to be a, well, I hope to be a research chemist.
#Person1#: Daniel, have you ever heard about the wildlife sanctuary?\n#Person2#: Is that different from this kind of zoo?\n#Person1#: Yes, of course.\n#Person2#: So tell me about it!\n#Person1#: There are a lot of wild animals in that place, and also some special rules while visiting.\n#Person2#: Special rules?\n#Person1#: There, you only have two ways for visiting.\n#Person2#: Details?\n#Person1#: On their bus or in your own cars, and you won't be allowed to get off the bus until you reach the special region.\n#Person2#: Why not?\n#Person1#: Because it is dangerous to get out of the car or bus. You can just imagine how fierce the wild animals can be.\n#Person2#: That makes sense. But that sounds interesting. Is there one in Beijing too?\n#Person1#: Yes.\n#Person2#: I prefer to go there next time.\n#Person1#: Yeah, sure, you won't be disappointed.
#Person1#: you haven't spent much time with Sophia lately. Are you speaking to each other at the moment?\n#Person2#: no, we're not. We've been drifting apart for a while.\n#Person1#: but you two used to do everything together. I thought you really enjoyed each other's company.\n#Person2#: we did, but since she started her new job, all she does is hang out with her new friends from work.\n#Person1#: can't you hang out with them, too?\n#Person2#: I could, but all they ever talk about is work, so I always end up feeling left out.\n#Person1#: maybe you should invite her over for dinner, so it's just the two of you.\n#Person2#: I tried that a few weeks ago and she ended bringing a pal from work with her! She's so busy these days that it's just impossible to hang out with her.\n#Person1#: it can't be that bad. She was always a really good friend to you.\n#Person2#: you're right. She would never talk about me behind my back or hold a grudge. But she just doesn't seem very interested in our friendship anymore.\n#Person1#: she's probably just excited about her new job. You should give her some time. It would be a shame to lose such a good friend.\n#Person2#: I've given her enough time. I'm over it now.\n#Person1#: I still think you two should try to patch things up.\n#Person2#: I think I just have to accept the fact that it's time for us to go our separate ways.
#Person1#: It's said you will go abroad to pursue your graduate studies.\n#Person2#: Yes, I've been thinking about visiting you. I hope to get some advice from you.\n#Person1#: Which country do you want to go to?\n#Person2#: My field is electronic engineering. Which country do you think I should go?\n#Person1#: Were I in your position, I'd go to America.\n#Person2#: Which university should I apply to?\n#Person1#: There are many universities for you to choose from. Some famous universities such as Harvard, Yale, the University of Michigan, and Massachusetts Institute of Technology are really wonderful places to study, but they are very competitive and expensive. Some smaller universities or institutes are also very nice but much cheaper.\n#Person2#: Oh, I see. Thank you very much.
#Person1#: I would like you to meet my family. Can you come to dinner next week at my parents'place?\n#Person2#: Yeuks! Do they know anything about me?\n#Person1#: Actually, I've told them a lot about you. They are excited to meet you.\n#Person2#: I'm a little nervous!\n#Person1#: I think you'll like them. My family is pretty laid back.\n#Person2#: How Ay people will be there at dinner?\n#Person1#: Let's see. there's my mom and dad and my two brothers and one of my sisters.\n#Person2#: That's good, I'm usually more comfortable in bigger families.
#Person1#: Hi, John. What brings you to town?\n#Person2#: Hi, Mary. Lily wanted me to buy her some things for the party.\n#Person1#: What do you think of the traffic today?\n#Person2#: It's pretty bad.\n#Person1#: Yeah. You can say that again. It's noisy too.\n#Person2#: I am glad I did not drive a car.
#Person1#: So how did you meet Bill?\n#Person2#: I met him through a computer bulletin board.\n#Person1#: Oh, really? Which bulletin board?\n#Person2#: It was one I used down at the local coffee house called the San Francisco Net. It's been around since around 1991.\n#Person1#: I've heard about that, but I've never tried it.\n#Person2#: You ought to. One dollar buys you 15 minutes of computer time. A Chat session links you with cappuccino sippers in other cafes and also to home computers on the network.\n#Person1#: I have no desire to talk on a network with a bunch of strangers.\n#Person2#: That's the whole point. All your inhibitions disappear because you can't see the other person. This network allows you to talk to people whom you normally wouldn't talk to.\n#Person1#: I just want a private conversation with one other person.\n#Person2#: You can do that. A private session lets two people talk alone. This techno-chat program lets you talk about anything with everybody, without prejudice because you can't see them.\n#Person1#: Well, maybe I'll tag along and watch how you talk.\n#Person2#: That's fine with me, but we'll have to get there early.

A poor boy called Peter was killed in the accident too.\n#Person1#: What a terrible accident! Who should be responsible for this traffic accident?\n#Person2#: I think both. They drove too fast. What's worse, one of them was drunk.\n#Person1#: Why do some guys like to drive so fast when they are drunk?\n#Person2#: I don't understand. Maybe they feel they are okay and driving fast seems very cool.

I'm James Wilson. Let me explain to you how things are. In recent months, the demand for residential properties has become extremely high. The price of residential properly has risen almost twenty percent.\n#Person2#: Really?

This camera is easy to operate.\n#Person1#: Where is it made?\n#Person2#: It's made in China.\n#Person1#: Is it expensive?\n#Person2#: Not very expensive.\n#Person1#: I'll take this one.\n#Person2#: OK. Do you want any film?\n#Person1#: Yes, give me two rolls of Kodak color film.\n#Person2#: Here you are.
#Person1#: Excuse me. I need some storybooks in easy English. Do you have anything like that?\n#Person2#: Well, there are a lot of storybooks upstairs in our children's section. Some are written for young children, others for teens. Maybe some of them will suit your needs.\n#Person1#: I'll go take a look. Thanks for your help.\n#Person2#: You're welcome.
#Person1#: Hey, Devi, have you thought about where would you like to go to dinner on Friday for your birthday?\n#Person2#: I am not sure. I don't know that many restaurants around here.\n#Person1#: You know, we could look online at the local Internet sites.\n#Person2#: Good. Let's take a look!\n#Person1#: What kind of food would you like?\n#Person2#: I enjoy Thai or Japanese the best.\n#Person1#: This one, Shogun, looks good.\n#Person2#: Oh yes, I've heard of that one. Everyone I've spoken with says that it is great!\n#Person1#: Would you like to go there then?\n#Person2#: I think that that would be a really good choice! Let's call and make a reservation.
#Person1#: I really like the record you lent me the other day.\n#Person2#: I'm glad you like it.\n#Person1#: And thank you very much for letting me keep it so long.\n#Person2#: Not at all.\n#Person1#: I'm most grateful. Everyone in our class enjoyed it.\n#Person2#: I'm glad.\n#Person1#: Would you mind my keeping it for another week?
#Person1#: Good day. How can we assist you?\n#Person2#: I need to get a Letter of Credit. Is this the right window?\n#Person1#: It certainly is. Do you have your contract and Import License?\n#Person2#: Yes, right here in my brief case. Just a moment, please.\n#Person1#: Thanks. What you need to do now is deposit 100 % of the guaranteed funds of your contract into your account with us.\n#Person2#: That's done. There is more than enough to cover the contract amount in our account.\n#Person1#: That's great. We will have to charge you 250 RMB for that service, though. Could you please fill in this? Thanks.
#Person1#: Good morning. I came in answer to your advertisement for a salesperson.\n#Person2#: I see. Will you walk this way, please? What experience have you had?\n#Person1#: I'm afraid I haven't had any experience in just this sort of work. I'm studying business administration in college. I want to get a job that would tie in with my studies.\n#Person2#: Have you got any selling experience at all?\n#Person1#: I worked in a department store in a small town last summer vacation.\n#Person2#: Now tell me about your educational background.\n#Person1#: I graduated from Beijing University. I majored in business administration.\n#Person2#: What courses have you completed?\n#Person1#: The courses I completed are marketing, business law, business English, statistics, marketing principles, sales management, distribution theory, economies and psychology.\n#Person2#: What subjects did you like most at university?\n#Person1#: I liked sales strategies most.\n#Person2#: Why would you like to work with us?\n#Person1#: It's an interesting job, and your company is one of the best known. Although I have no work experience as a salesperson, the job description you sent was very interesting. It's a job I've been dreaming of when I was at university.\n#Person2#: What are your future plans and what kind of expectations do you have of the company?\n#Person1#: I have an interest in marketing and I would consider graduate study in business in the future. I think my goals will become more clear as I gain experience in sales and marketing.\n#Person2#: Good. Do you know anything about this company?\n#Person1#: Yes, a little. As you mentioned just now, yours is an American capital company. As far as I know your company is a world famous one which produces cosmetics and skincare products.\n#Person2#: Have you got anything to ask me?\n#Person1#: Will traveling be required in this position?\n#Person2#: Yes.\n#Person1#: How often?\n#Person2#: Three times a year at most. How do you feel about this?\n#Person1#: That's fine.
#Person1#: How do you understand the organizational structure of a company?\n#Person2#: The organizational structure is the company's framework of communication and authority.\n#Person1#: Is it true that just like a human skeleton that defines their shapes, companies have structures that define theirs?\n#Person2#: Yes, you are right.
#Person1#: Anna, come in, please.\n#Person2#: Yes, Mr. Green. What would you like me to do?\n#Person1#: I need a bus ticket to Seattle.\n#Person2#: What time do you want to leave, Mr. Green?\n#Person1#: Well, tomorrow morning, as early as I can. I have an appointment before noon.\n#Person2#: There's a bus every thirty minutes starting at 5:30 a.m.\n#Person1#: In that ease, I'd like to leave then. Wait... My wife's going to drop me off here on her way to work. Could you book me a 6:30 ticket instead?\n#Person2#: Sure. Will it be one way or round-trip?\n#Person1#: Oh, I probably should buy a round-trip ticket now, since I'll be coming back tomorrow evening. Oh, is there a bus around 6?\n#Person2#: Yes, there's one at 5:45. You'd get back before 8 o'clock?\n#Person1#: OK, I'll take that one. I told my wife we'd see a movie at 9:30.
#Person1#: Good afternoon. Can I help you, sir?\n#Person2#: I made a reservation last week by the name of Benjamin. We've just arrived.\n#Person1#: A minute, please. Benjamin... Oh, yes, here it is. One double room for a whole week. Here is the registration card. Would you please fill this form out, sir?\n#Person2#: Love to! (A few minutes later) Done! Here you are.\n#Person1#: Thank you. Now everything is in order. Your room number is 8715.\n#Person2#: Is it on the 87th floor?\n#Person1#: No, sir. In China, eight is a lucky number. It's actually on the 7th floor.\n#Person2#: Thank you. By the way, is there a dressing table in the room?\n#Person1#: Yes. A traditional wooden one.
#Person1#: Ok, so what happened when you got to the airport?\n#Person2#: Well, I waited in a queue for ages and finally it was my turn to come up to the desk. I was asked to present a visa.\n#Person1#: Yes, you need a visa. Your travel agent should have told you.\n#Person2#: But I think I was there six years ago.
#Person1#: What are you reading, Bill?\n#Person2#: It's this week New Scientist. Why?\n#Person1#: I was just wondering. It looks interesting. But I've never actually read myself. It's for real scientists, or can ordinary people like me understand it?\n#Person2#: Always for anyone, really. It usually has articles or stories about current affairs about science, as well as papers about new development in research. I'm reading about new telephone that allows you to see the person you are speaking to as well as see him.\n#Person1#: Oh, I heard about it. Is it on the market yet? Can I buy one?\n#Person2#: No. Not this one. But the company has made other models to try on business. This one is special because its color and image is moving.\n#Person1#: Oh, that's interesting.\n#Person2#: You see the first video phones. That's what they are called. They made in Japan. But they can only show still black and white image. So this video phone is much better than that. Mind you, I'm not sure I want one, would you?\n#Person1#: Well, no, I don't think a word. I bet it costs a lot of money. Did it say how much it costs?\n#Person2#: Yes. The yearly black and white one costs several hundreds pounds. But one in the story is about to cost several thousands pounds.\n#Person1#: Hmm, what does anybody want one, do you think?\n#Person2#: Business organizations that need frequent contact overseas want it. It's like a face-to-face conversation, so maybe a lot of overseas travels can be avoided.\n#Person1#: Yes, I suppose so.
#Person1#: Hey, I know you. You're James, right? James Roberts.\n#Person2#: Amanda Brown. Wow! It's been a long time.\n#Person1#: Yeah. Oh, are you going to the class reunion in two weeks?\n#Person2#: Uh, I heard about it, but I'm not sure. Where is it?\n#Person1#: The reunion is going to be held at the Mountain Country Club across from City Park.\n#Person2#: And what time does it start?\n#Person1#: I think it starts at 6:00.\n#Person2#: And how much does it cost?\n#Person1#: It's twenty dollars a ticket, and that includes dinner and entertainment.\n#Person2#: What kind of entertainment are they going to have?\n#Person1#: They're going to have a live jazz band and dancing.\n#Person2#: And who is organizing the event?\n#Person1#: Do you remember Chad Phillips?\n#Person2#: Uh, wasn't he the quarterback on the football team?\n#Person1#: Right. Well, he married Sarah Rogers, and they are in charge of the event. So, what do you think? Are you going?\n#Person2#: I don't know. I never really fit in in high school. I was kind of a loner. I also remember asking Sarah out on a date, and she turned me down. She said she was sick, and it turned out she went out with someone that same night. It could be a little awkward.\n#Person1#: Hey, why don't we go together?\n#Person2#: Are you sure?\n#Person1#: Yeah.\n#Person2#: Well, sure. Why not. To be honest, I always thought you were very nice. I just never had the guts to ask you out.\n#Person1#: Well, here's your chance.\n#Person2#: Sounds great. So, what's your number so I can call you?\n#Person1#: It's 435-923-6017.\n#Person2#: 6017, Okay. Where do you live?\n#Person1#: I only live two blocks south of the old high school.\n#Person2#: Okay. I remember where you live. Let me call you a few days before to confirm things.\n#Person1#: Sounds good. It should be fun.
#Person1#: I've got a new boss. \n#Person2#: Oh, what's he like? \n#Person1#: Well, he's got dark hair and brown eyes. \n#Person2#: Yes. \n#Person1#: And a white sports car. \n#Person2#: Um, that's good. \n#Person1#: Yes, but he's got a wife and 3 children as well. 
#Person1#: I want to buy a wallet. \n#Person2#: Here are all the wallets with various designs. How about this one ? It is quite fashionable. \n#Person1#: May I pick it up? \n#Person2#: Of course. \n#Person1#: Do you have one of better quality? \n#Person2#: This one is much better, but it is also much more expensive. \n#Person1#: There is no problem about the price. How much is it? \n#Person2#: Two hundred and thirty-five yuan. \n#Person1#: OK, I'll take it. 
#Person1#: Hi, Lisa! \n#Person2#: Hi, Kate! \n#Person1#: I'm looking for the registration. Do you know where the registration is? \n#Person2#: Yes, it's right over there in Room 133 on the right. \n#Person1#: Excuse me, is this registration? \n#Person3#: Yes, I need some information for your registration card. \n#Person1#: OK. \n#Person3#: What's your full name? \n#Person1#: Lisa Smith. \n#Person3#: What's your school address? \n#Person1#: 820 University, Box 4348, Chicago, Illinois. \n#Person3#: Your telephone number? \n#Person1#: 431-893-7323. \n#Person3#: Thank you. 
#Person1#: Excuse me, I'm looking for your casual short-sleeved shirts. Can you tell me where those are? \n#Person2#: Right over here, sir. What size do you wear? \n#Person1#: Medium. \n#Person2#: These here are all mediums. \n#Person1#: Thank you. I think I'll take this one, and these pants as well. They're a present for a friend. \n#Person2#: Shall I gift-wrap them for you, sir? \n#Person1#: Yes, please. 
#Person1#: Has your son started school yet, Tom? \n#Person2#: Next week, it's going to be quite a shock for him! \n#Person1#: He'll get used to it. They always do. I still remember when my daughter started. Are you going with him on his first day? \n#Person2#: You bet. I wouldn't miss it! 
#Person1#: Any plans tonight? \n#Person2#: Not really, do you? \n#Person1#: Well, I am wondering if we took a hang-out for a drink or something. You know, I just came back from a really tough interview. I was quite nervous during the interview. I really want to have the job. Right now, I am still a little on the edge. I am not sure if I could convince them during the interview. \n#Person2#: Take it easy. It is all over now. How was it going, anyway? \n#Person1#: I don't know. I think I did well in the paper exams. I was prepared to answer a lot of questions, but they didn't ask those as I expected. To my surprise, the manager tried to talk about the Chinese poesy with me. \n#Person2#: That's strange. But probably, it is the new interview technique they call it 'Getting to know you more personally'. What about your answers? \n#Person1#: Just did my best. 
#Person1#: Do you know Sally? \n#Person2#: Sally? She is a bachelor girl. She is an excellent designer. Many of the company's advertisements are her child trains. \n#Person1#: Why is she still single? She must have a face that would stop a clock. \n#Person2#: Oh, quite the other way round. She is a knock-out. She devotes much of her time to her career. 
#Person1#: I was looking for books on small business startups and I think these are perfect. I'm going to start my own company in my back office.\n#Person2#: That sounds interesting. So you'd like to check all these out?\n#Person1#: Yes, for a few days at least.\n#Person2#: No problem then. I'll just need to see your library card.\n#Person1#: I'm afraid I've lost it.\n#Person2#: That's alright. Could you just tell me your library account number?\n#Person1#: I'm sorry. I don't remember it.\n#Person2#: We can look it up for you. Just give me your username for the library website and I'll find your account number.\n#Person1#: Oh, dear. I don't usually use the website.
#Person1#: Hi. Very glad to meet you here.\n#Person2#: Hi. Have we met before?\n#Person1#: Aren't you the woman who gave the computer lecturer at the city library last winter?\n#Person2#: Yes, it's me. You look familiar. Were you there in my class then?\n#Person1#: Yes, sure. I'm so glad I took your lecture and I've benefited quite a lot from it.\n#Person2#: Thanks. It's also rewarding for me to do something meaningful in my spare time.\n#Person1#: Oh, I thought you were a IT engineer or something like an expert in this profession.\n#Person2#: Not exactly, but I know a bit about computer.\n#Person1#: I thought that it would be impossible for me to learn how to use a computer at my age, but now I'm exchanging emails with my grandchildren. They say I am learning fast and well. It's the happiest thing after my retirement.\n#Person2#: That's great. Giving a lecture after work is a good experience for me because that is a change of pace from my daytime job as a sales representative.\n#Person1#: That's right.
#Person1#: Did you see those robots? They were so smart. I can't believe how many different kinds there were at the technology show. They could do so many things too. Even activities that I thought could only be done by human hands.\n#Person2#: It's really amazing.\n#Person1#: I understand why they say that China's future is in robots, they will change society.\n#Person2#: That's exactly what I'm afraid of. Can we predict what the consequences will be?\n#Person1#: Well, it is hard to say.\n#Person2#: I'm worried what the average person will experience as they communicate with robots on a daily basis. We are already surrounded by technology day and night in this modern society. Will some people completely lose the ability to form relationships with other people? These are some of the questions I'll be researching for my term paper.\n#Person1#: I understand your concerns, but I think our country needs to become more competitive, with other countries that are also developing this technology.\n#Person2#: We can ask professor Smith to talk a bit more about this in his next class.
#Person1#: Phil, you said you're a teacher. And did you study education in college?\n#Person2#: No, I studied construction. Actually I worked as a designer when I was younger. That was a really great job. But I kind of came into teaching just to try something different.\n#Person1#: Do you like electronic products?\n#Person2#: Yeah, I do. My favorite is my laptop. I think everyone should have a laptop now because it's so useful. I can watch movies, download music from the Internet and most important, I can write reports on my students on my laptop. It's just amazing what you can do today.\n#Person1#: Any other products you especially like? An MP4 player or an iPad?\n#Person2#: No, I suppose I would have to say my digital camera. I'm absolutely useless had taking photographs. I always miss the main part of the picture, however, with a digital camera, I can keep taking photos again and again until I know I've got the one I actually want. The digital Camera is perfect for me. I can choose only the photos I want.\n#Person1#: Yeah, I agree. I use cameras a lot for my website. I couldn't make it without them.
#Person1#: Alice, what's your favorite movie of the year twenty seventeen?\n#Person2#: I must say it's Wonder Woman. When the movie was released in June last year, my parents were eager to take me to see it.\n#Person1#: Why did your parents want to take you to watch it so much?\n#Person2#: They considered it quite a different movie. You know, it is really rare to see a female action hero in a big budget movie. And it was also directed by a woman. I guess my parents wanted to show me that women could be powerful too.\n#Person1#: So do you think that the movie was a big success?\n#Person2#: You bet. It made more than 400 million dollars in ticket sales in the United States. In fact, there were only two bigger money makers among that years movies.\n#Person1#: Did you watch any other movies directed by women in twenty seventeen?\n#Person2#: Certainly. Women were in charge of more than 60 films in that year, including Before I Fall, Lady Bird and Battle of the Sexes. Among these three, I preferred the last.
#Person1#: So, Claire, you're into drama.\n#Person2#: Yes, I have a master's degree in drama and theater. At the moment, I'm hoping to get on to a PhD program.\n#Person1#: What excites you about drama?\n#Person2#: Well, I find it's a communicative way to study people and you learn how to read people in drama. So usually I can understand what people are saying even though they might be lying.\n#Person1#: That would be useful?\n#Person2#: Yeah, it's very useful for me as well. I'm an English lecture, so use a lot of drama in my classes, such as role plays. And I asked my students to create mini dramas. They really respond well. At the moment, I'm hoping to get on to a PhD course. I'd like to concentrate on Asian drama and try to bring Asian theater to the world's attention. I don't know how successful I would be, but here's hoping.\n#Person1#: Oh, I'm sure you'll be successful.
#Person1#: How long will it take for our order to be delivered?\n#Person2#: Let's see. You are importing fifty containers of textiles from China. They should be able to place your order before the end of next week. It will take 2 days for shipping to the port city of Ningpo. The freight will take 3 weeks on the open ocean and will arrive in Los Angeles approximately a month from today. Domestic shipping will be your responsibility, you can make arrangements with the pier in Los Angeles.\n#Person1#: Fine, we will handle domestic shipping, but what about customs? Will we have to pay tariff on our imports? I hope we don't run into any problems with the border control.\n#Person2#: No, the Chinese company has that all worked out. With the paperwork you receive with the shipment, you should be good to go.
#Person1#: Could you tell me something about your family?\n#Person2#: OK. There are five people in my family, Father, mother, elder brother, younger sister and I.\n#Person1#: Are your brother and sister still in school?\n#Person2#: My brother has found his job and my sister is still in college.\n#Person1#: What does your father do?\n#Person2#: My father is a middle school teacher.\n#Person1#: What about your mother?\n#Person2#: My mother is a housewife.\n#Person1#: Are you married?\n#Person2#: I am not married yet and I live alone now.\n#Person1#: Do you need to support your family?\n#Person2#: No, my father and brother are doing that.\n#Person1#: Have you finished school?\n#Person2#: Yes, I have already graduated.
#Person1#: Now people are talking about world recession which started more than a year ago. Can you give us your personal assessment of the situation of the global economy?\n#Person2#: As you know, we are in a very special time. This is a very hard time for many countries ' economics, both developed and developing. I think the current economic situation could be described as synchronized slowdown of major economies.\n#Person1#: What is the direct impact of the terrorist attack upon your country's economy?\n#Person2#: Once the US economy is in trouble due to the terrorist attack, the impact could be quickly felt in the rest of the world.\n#Person1#: What challenges is your country's economy facing at the moment?\n#Person2#: We do face a lot of challenges because there is still much uncertainty about the world economy. It's very important for us to strike a proper balance between investment in fixed assets and household consumption.
#Person1#: May I know where you are going?\n#Person2#: Yes. I want to go to Beijing Hotel.\n#Person1#: I'm sorry. You are going in the wrong direction.\n#Person2#: Oh no! What shall I do?\n#Person1#: Don't worry. You can get off at the next stop and go across the street through the overpass. The bus stop is right there.\n#Person2#: Thank you very much.\n#Person1#: My pleasure.
#Person1#: Wei! This is a first time you didn't bargain!\n#Person2#: Bargain? I'd feel way too guilty.\n#Person1#: But you could have saved money.\n#Person2#: From a sweet ma?! It's not worth it. Plus, I'd happily pay more for these things I bought!\n#Person1#: F. Y. I . , there is a flea market nearby, but maybe you're done...\n#Person2#: Ha! I'm just warming up! Please take me there now!
#Person1#: Did you promise me to get the bread?\n#Person2#: Well, I remember walking pass the baker shop.\n#Person1#: But you forgot to get the bread.\n#Person2#: I'm afraid so. I don't remember you telling me about it.\n#Person1#: Well, I certainly did.\n#Person2#: What would you let me do now?\n#Person1#: You are free. You can go now.\n#Person2#: Really? You are so kind.\n#Person1#: I'll do with the cake.\n#Person2#: No. That's not enough. I've got some cereal.
#Person1#: Can you pick up some things from the store for me?\n#Person2#: Of course, what do you need?\n#Person1#: I need a few things, I'll give you the list.\n#Person2#: Is there something else you need that you can think of?\n#Person1#: Everything I need is on the list.\n#Person2#: Do you want me to make any other stops while I'm out?\n#Person1#: Since you asked, would you pick up my medicine from the pharmacy?\n#Person2#: Is it ready to be picked up?\n#Person1#: I believe so.\n#Person2#: No problem. I'll do that for you.\n#Person1#: I really appreciate you doing this for me.\n#Person2#: It's no problem at all.
#Person1#: I would like to pick a time to look at houses with you.\n#Person2#: Would mornings or afternoons be best for you?\n#Person1#: It is easier for me to take off work in the afternoon.\n#Person2#: It is best if we can go during the week ; does that work for you?\n#Person1#: Because of work, I can only go look at houses on the weekend.\n#Person2#: Would you like to meet at the real estate office, or should I pick you up at home?\n#Person1#: If you could pick me up at home, that would be great.\n#Person2#: We could spend most of the day looking at houses to see all that we have to see.\n#Person1#: That might be a little too much, but we'll see how it goes.\n#Person2#: I will fax you a schedule as soon as I contact the owners to confirm the times.
#Person1#: There is a tornado warning on. My mother just told me she heard it on the radio.\n#Person2#: What is a tornado warning?\n#Person1#: It means that a tornado has been seen somewhere in the area.\n#Person2#: Really? In New Berlin?\n#Person1#: No. Not necessarily in town. But in southern Wisconsin somewhere. A tornado has been spotted. They have two stages here. This is what is called a ' tornado watch. ' That means that the weather conditions are perfect for a tornado.\n#Person2#: I understand. They think a tornado might come.\n#Person1#: Yes. People should look out, because maybe there will be tornadoes coming. So it's called a ' watch. '\n#Person2#: And the second stage is called a ' tornado warning '.\n#Person1#: Yes. If a tornado has been spotted, they announce a ' tornado warning '. So if there's a tornado warning on, it means a tornado is out there somewhere.\n#Person2#: It's scary.\n#Person1#: Well. Tornadoes can be dangerous, it's true. If we hear something like a loud train coming, then we have to go in the basement.\n#Person2#: What do you mean ' a loud train '?\n#Person1#: That is what tornadoes sound like. They sound like trains. They're very loud.\n#Person2#: But if you hear them coming, isn't it already too late?\n#Person1#: Maybe. It depends on the tornado. Some can move across the ground at 200 miles an hour. That is very fast. Others aren't so fast.\n#Person2#: Have you seen a lot of them?\n#Person1#: I've only seen one in my life. I was looking out the window. It was around two miles away. It was very interesting to watch. But it was heading toward my friend's house. So I quickly called them on the phone.\n#Person2#: Did it hit their house?\n#Person1#: No, it didn't. But they are glad I called them.\n#Person2#: What were they doing when you called?\n#Person1#: They were all sitting in the living room watching TV. They had no idea a tornado was coming toward their house. If it had hit them, they could have all been killed.\n#Person2#: That's terrible. Do many people die in tornadoes?\n#Person1#: Not so many really. But a lot of houses are destroyed sometimes.
#Person1#: The band is pretty good. How do you like the music?\n#Person2#: It's very nice. I haven't heard live music in a while. This is fun.\n#Person1#: Well, then, may I invite you for the next dance?\n#Person2#: Of course. But I'm afraid I'm not much of a dancer. . .\n#Person1#: Don't worry. I'm not much of a dancer myself.\n#Person2#: You're dancing so well.\n#Person1#: You dance beautifully too.\n#Person2#: When did you learn to dance?\n#Person1#: In college. But I don't dance very often. What's your favourite dance?\n#Person2#: It's hard to say. It depends. But I love the waltz.
#Person1#: Oh, hi Pam. When did you get back from Canada? How was it?\n#Person2#: The day before yesterday. I only visited Montreal and Ottawa, but I had a great time.\n#Person1#: Which city did you like better?\n#Person2#: That's hard to say. . . I think Ottawa is prettier. It has better sightseeing, too. A lot of museums and galleries.\n#Person1#: And what's Montreal like? What did you think of it?\n#Person2#: Montreal is more exciting. It has better shopping. The stores are cheaper and more interesting.\n#Person1#: Which one has better nightlife?\n#Person2#: Oh, Montreal of sure. It has more restaurants and clubs. They say Montreal is the most exciting city in Canada.\n#Person1#: Well, I've always wanted to see Vancouver. I've heard it has the most beautiful views.
#Person1#: well, I finished my last final today.\n#Person2#: the end of all the hard work for my master's. what a nice feeling to get my degree!\n#Person1#: do you want to attend the convocation?\n#Person2#: certainly. After years of hard work, I wouldn't miss it. By the way, where can I find cap and gown?\n#Person1#: do you want to have them made or do you want to rent them?\n#Person2#: oh, I think they're provided by the school for that special day.\n#Person1#: no. those you have to provide for yourself.\n#Person2#: what do most of the students do?\n#Person1#: well, most of them only need a cap and gown for that particular convocation service, but some of the education majors have had them made, because they will be faculty members, and they'll need them for student commencement each year.\n#Person2#: then, I might as well have them made.\n#Person1#: Mary, don't move. Stand right there. It's a good shot. The background is very pretty.\n#Person2#: hold it a second. I want to fix my hairpin.\n#Person1#: it doesn't matter. Say'cheese'.\n#Person2#: here's Lisa. May I take a picture with her?\n#Person1#: Certainly. Ok, got you.
#Person1#: So, have you seen all three The Lord of the Rings movies?\n#Person2#: Yes, but I didn't really like the third one at all.\n#Person1#: That's the Return of the King, right?\n#Person2#: Yeah. Even though the customs were brilliant, I didn't think it was as good as the first two. What did you think?\n#Person1#: I thought the special effects were amazing, but I got a bit confused. The plot was too complicated for me.\n#Person2#: Did you read the books before you watched the movies?\n#Person1#: No. did you?\n#Person2#: Yes, I've read them many times. I think it's much easier to follow for people who were already familiar with all the characters.\n#Person1#: Yes, trying to keep track of all the characters was quite confusing for me.\n#Person2#: I also think that it was much better in the theatre than at home.\n#Person1#: Most movies are. Another problem for me was the film was dubbed in German with English subtitles.\n#Person2#: That happens a lot in non-English speaking countries.\n#Person1#: I heard that The Return of the King was nominated for 11 Oscars.\n#Person2#: Actually, they not only had 11 nominations, but they won 11 Oscars, too!
#Person1#: Are you a happy married man?\n#Person2#: Yes, I am. My wife and I understand each other.\n#Person1#: You are a lucky man. How about Mr. Smith.\n#Person2#: I don't know. But they say that Mrs. Smith wears the pants in the house.\n#Person1#: You mean she bosses her husband around?\n#Person2#: That's right. She is pretty, but she wants to control everything in his life.
#Person1#: I'd love that. I'm so glad I quit. It's time for a change.\n#Person2#: Does that mean you're going to take my advice?\n#Person1#: Yes. I'm looking for a position as a chef.\n#Person2#: I might be able to help. . .\n#Person1#: I'm sure you have great connections.\n#Person2#: We'd like to open another restaurant. . . with you as the head chef and manager. . .\n#Person1#: Really? You have that much faith in me? And Giovanni agreed to it? Does he know who I am?\n#Person2#: Yes. But you know him. He's just worried that you're not Italian. . .\n#Person1#: He's prejudiced, isn't he?\n#Person2#: No. He's afraid that no one will cook as good as his mother did.\n#Person1#: Ah! I know a way to convince him that Americans can make good Italian food!\n#Person2#: How's that?\n#Person1#: You'll see next week. I'll come by one day at lunchtime.
#Person1#: Hello. What can we do for you today?\n#Person2#: I've just had some money sent from Germany, in Euros.\n#Person1#: OK, could you give me your details and I'll see if it has cleared. We need your banking details and some ID. A passport or something like that?\n#Person2#: I have my passport right here, and here are the account details. The name, number. . .\n#Person1#: Mr. Jurgen, yes, the remittance has been successful.\n#Person2#: That was quick! I didn't expect it to come through so quickly. Yes, that is good news. The full amount should be 20, 000 Euros, is that right? I'd like to withdraw 5, 000 Euros worth of local currency, if that's possible.\n#Person1#: Not a problem, Sir. Please fill in this exchange form and show me your passport.
#Person1#: Excuse me, could I ask a favour?\n#Person2#: Sure, go ahead.\n#Person1#: Could you tell me where the canteen is?\n#Person2#: Sure, I can take you there actually.\n#Person1#: Oh, I don't want to trouble you.\n#Person2#: It's fine. I was heading there anyway.
#Person1#: What's your name?\n#Person2#: My name is Wang Lin. My English name is Linda.\n#Person1#: A nice name, isn't it?\n#Person2#: Yeah, like it very much. My name has become a part of me.\n#Person1#: Where do you live?\n#Person2#: I live in the Haitian District.\n#Person1#: Oh, It's really far from here. May I ask how old you are?\n#Person2#: Yes, I'm 38 years old.\n#Person1#: You look very young.\n#Person2#: Thanks.\n#Person1#: Where is your birthplace?\n#Person2#: My birthplace is Yentai.
#Person1#: Good afternoon, sir, is there anything I can do for you?\n#Person2#: Yes. I can't find my sweater. I have my laundry sent to you yesterday but when the washing is done. I find my swatter missing.\n#Person1#: Well, it's our fault. We are sorry for that. Would you please fill out the form? We will pay for you.\n#Person2#: That's fine. Maybe you should be more careful.
#Person1#: Mr. Smith, I would like to get right to the point here. First, we need to talk about how much each company will pay.\n#Person2#: Well, we want to have the largest share. Our company is much larger than yours, and we have been in business longer.\n#Person1#: Let's look at that another way. The major point is the value that we add, not who has been in business longer, or is bigger.\n#Person2#: What are you thinking about?\n#Person1#: We do not want to place ourselves in an inferior position. We are a good, small company---that's why you are interested.\n#Person2#: Then, what would make you feel more comfortable?\n#Person1#: If you take a 75 % position in the venture, we would take a back seat to you.
#Person1#: Hey, Ken. . . I need to talk to you.\n#Person2#: Sure. . . what's up?\n#Person1#: Can we step into the conference room? This is a more private conversation.\n#Person2#: Sure. . .\n#Person1#: Ok. . . I'm just going to lay it all out on the table, What do you think of Vincent's management style?\n#Person2#: Well, Vincent has only been CEO for a couple of years and. . . well. . . um. . .\n#Person1#: I don't want to put you on the spot. Here's what I'm getting at, I don't think Vincent is the man for the job.\n#Person2#: Really? And what led you to this conclusion?\n#Person1#: As I see it, he lacks the proper vision. His style is more about survival, and he's not taking the company anywhere. He's treading water instead of swimming.\n#Person2#: Well, I confess I've had my doubts about his abilities before. It seems he mainly got the job because his famous aunt pulled some strings.\n#Person1#: I've been with this firm for 26 years and I'd hate to see it go down the drain due to poor leadership skills.\n#Person2#: Me too. But what can we do? This isn't a reality TV show. . . we can't just vote him out.\n#Person1#: Yes and no. . . We can't ask for a show of hands on who thinks he should be fired, but we can introduce a vote of no confidence at the next board meeting.\n#Person2#: Interesting idea. You might be on to something.
#Person1#: Hey Mark. What are you doing?\n#Person2#: Just watching some TV.\n#Person1#: Anything interesting on?\n#Person2#: Not really. Just watching the sports highlight on ESPN.\n#Person1#: So I take it you're pretty bored too.\n#Person2#: Just killing time until I find something to do. What are you going to do?\n#Person1#: It's Saturday and we are sitting at home doing nothing. What's wrong with us?\n#Person2#: You wanna shoot some hoops?\n#Person1#: I already tried to call up some of the guys, but they are all busy.\n#Person2#: Where's your girlfriend? I thought you were going out with her today.\n#Person1#: She's out shopping with her friends.\n#Person2#: Let's go to Starbucks and think of something to do then.\n#Person1#: Aright. Do you have any cigarettes?\n#Person2#: I only have a couple left. Why don't you pick some up on the way.\n#Person1#: Ok. See you there in about 30 minutes.\n#Person2#: Aright. See you there.
#Person1#: Kenvir? Hi, it's Alice. I'm very sorry that I have a big favor to ask you again.\n#Person2#: How big, Alice? Last time you said that, I ended up working overtime 4 nights.\n#Person1#: Well, I've got a huge load of typing and Mr. Brown has insisted I get it done by tomorrow afternoon. Could you help me to type half of it?\n#Person2#: All right, Alice. But this is the last time. I also have a lot of work to do.\n#Person1#: Thank you, Kenvir. You're so kind.
#Person1#: I'm a bit worried about you going shopping by yourself this afternoon.\n#Person2#: Oh don't worry, I'll be fine.\n#Person1#: But what will you do if you need to know the price of something?\n#Person2#: If I need to know the price, I'll just look at the label.\n#Person1#: Ok, but what will you do if you want to check the size of the clothes?\n#Person2#: I'll try them on.\n#Person1#: And what will you do if you don't have enough cash?\n#Person2#: Then I'll just use my credit card.
#Person1#: Susan, we're going to need those data before tomorrow.\n#Person2#: I know. I'm just waiting for confirmation on one of them. I can get them to you by tomorrow morning.\n#Person1#: Yeah? All right. Thanks, Susan.\n#Person2#: That's all right.
#Person1#: I'd like to buy these shoes.\n#Person2#: O. K. Let me see. That will be $ 104. 99.\n#Person1#: The price tag says $ 99. 99.\n#Person2#: Yes, miss, but there is a five percent sales tax in Maryland.\n#Person1#: Oh, of course. How silly of me to forget.\n#Person2#: No problem. How would you like to pay for these?\n#Person1#: I think I have the cash. Let me check. Yes, here you are.\n#Person2#: $ 110. 00, your change is $ 5. 01. Thanks very much.\n#Person1#: Thank you.
#Person1#: Thank you for your application, Mr. Sweeney. Mr. Jacobs would like to set up an interview for early next week. Do you have time?\n#Person2#: Yes, ma'am. I could come in any day next week, except for Friday morning.\n#Person1#: Fine. Let me take a look at his schedule. He's free on Tuesday afternoon at 1:30. Could you come in then?\n#Person2#: Yes. That would be fine.
#Person1#: Do you want a taxi?\n#Person2#: Yes.\n#Person1#: Where to?\n#Person2#: Do you know where Dawanglu is?\n#Person1#: Yes, I know it.\n#Person2#: You can take me there?\n#Person1#: Yes, of course. Step in, please!\n#Person2#: That's good.\n#Person1#: Buckle up the belt, please.\n#Person2#: Let's go.
#Person1#: May I speak to the apartment building manager, please?\n#Person2#: I'm the manager. How can I help you?\n#Person1#: I was hoping that the apartment on Main Street was still available.\n#Person2#: Why, yes, it is. Would you like to get a look inside the apartment?\n#Person1#: Yes, it would be nice to see the apartment.\n#Person2#: How about today at 6 o'clock?\n#Person1#: Yes, I can be there at 6.\n#Person2#: Sounds good. I'll see you at 6. Do you want directions?\n#Person1#: I'm okay, thank you. I already checked out the address on MapQuest.\n#Person2#: If you like the place, you can fill out an application form. I'll bring one with me.\n#Person1#: Is there anything that I need to bring with me?\n#Person2#: No. I won't need to see anything except your driver's license.
#Person1#: Hello, Sir. Can I help you with anything?\n#Person2#: Yes, I would like to use the ATM to make a payment. But I need to pay 3 parties at once.\n#Person1#: No problem at all. With this service, you can pay up to 10 parties at one time. Are these parties on your current beneficiaries list?\n#Person2#: They are, yes. How should I do this?\n#Person1#: Select'pay multiple beneficiaries', here. . . then select'pay from the account'in the drop down menu. . . OK, good. Then we need to enter the beneficiary statement reference.\n#Person2#: Yes, I've got that here. . .\n#Person1#: And your statement reference and the payment amount. Click on next, then'pay beneficiaries'. That's it! All done.
#Person1#: Good evening, sir, madam. A table for two?\n#Person2#: No, thank you. But we have a small problem. Can you help us?\n#Person1#: Sure. What can I do for you?\n#Person2#: We are looking for a hotel. Are there any hotels near here?\n#Person1#: Yes, there are some hotels in the street. The nearest one is next to the bank. It's quite modern.\n#Person2#: Do you think there're any inexpensive ones nearby? We're leaving tomorrow morning.\n#Person1#: Yes. Drive west for about two minutes and you will find a grey building on the right side. It's a traditional family style hotel, very comfortable, and the price is quite reasonable.\n#Person2#: It sounds nice. Thank you very much for your help.\n#Person1#: That's all right.
#Person1#: Packages Express. May I help you?\n#Person2#: Yes. Hi. I sent a package last Thursday, and I'd like to track my order.\n#Person1#: No problem. I can check the shipment on the computer for you. This Monday's order... Let me see. Ah, it's here, last Thursday. Do you have your order number?\n#Person2#: Sure. It's 6-0-1-4-2-8.\n#Person1#: OK. And the last name on that order?\n#Person2#: It's Conley. That's C-O-N-L-E-Y.\n#Person1#: And where did you send the package to?\n#Person2#: San Francisco.\n#Person1#: Mm-hmm. And the postal code there is 9-5-1-2-6. Yes, it looks like the pack arrived safely on Tuesday morning. Your friend can get the package at the counter numbered 4-2-3-6.\n#Person2#: That's great. Thank you very much for your help.\n#Person1#: You're welcome.
#Person1#: Graham, why are you always on the phone with Jane? \n#Person2#: Because we are partners in our science lab. Why are you so jealous? \n#Person1#: The other night when you came home there was lipstick on your right cheek. How do you explain that? \n#Person2#: My aunt Mary just flew in from Cleveland and she laid one right on my right cheek. \n#Person1#: Are you sure? \n#Person2#: Of course I am. I only love you, Amy. \n#Person1#: Okay, I'm sorry. I believe you. \n#Person2#: Why do you always accuse me like that? \n#Person1#: Because you are the most handsome boy at the university and I love you so much! I guess I just go crazy sometimes. That's all. \n#Person2#: Oh, Amy. I am the luckiest guy in the world. \n#Person1#: Why? \n#Person2#: Because I am loved by the most beautiful girl in the world! \n#Person1#: Oh. Graham. I love you so much and I really believe in our love. 
#Person1#: Where do you live, Kim? \n#Person2#: I live in an apartment downtown. \n#Person1#: Oh, that's convenient, but . . . how much crime is there? \n#Person2#: Not much. But there is a lot of traffic. I can't stand the noise sometimes! Where do you live? \n#Person1#: . I have a house in the suburbs. \n#Person2#: Oh, I bet it's really quiet. But is there much to do there? \n#Person1#: No, not much. In fact, nothing ever really happens. That's the trouble. \n#Person2#: Hey. Let's trade places one weekend! \n#Person1#: OK. Great idea! 
#Person1#: more and more Chinese are marrying foreigners. \n#Person2#: that's true. But I have a low opinion of those women who go out with foreigners. \n#Person1#: oh, why? \n#Person2#: I think some Chinese women marry foreigners for money while others just want to live abroad. There is no true love between them.\n#Person1#: I wouldn't say that's totally true. I've met many happy intercultural couples. \n#Person2#: well, then why aren't there many East-West couples where the man is a Chinese and the woman is a Westerner? \n#Person1#: I guess it's because the Chinese women are more attractive to Western men. \n#Person2#: or because they are less attractive to to Chinese men. \n#Person1#: what do you mean? \n#Person2#: you know, usually the woman is in her thirties and she is a left girl. \n#Person1#: a left girl? What's that? \n#Person2#: they're called that because they're left behind on the shelf. They're also known by their three H's---high diploma, high salary, and high degree. and they're also known as the three S's single, \n#Person1#: you have a point here, but I believe some mixed marriages are based on true love. \n#Person2#: that' for sure but very few. 
#Person1#: Betty, would you please read this letter of application I've just written? I'd like to have your opinion. \n#Person2#: I'd be glad to tell you what I think. \n#Person1#: Good ! I'm interested in your advice. \n#Person2#: If I were you, I would change the beginning . You should write about your education first because we like to judge a man by his abilities. \n#Person1#: Good idea, Betty. What would you think about the second part? \n#Person2#: I think it's too short. You'd better say something about your work experience. \n#Person1#: You're right, I'll change it . How about the last part? \n#Person2#: Very good. But you should talk about your family, too. \n#Person1#: I agree. I appreciate your helping me. 
#Person1#: Are you ready to order now, sir? \n#Person2#: Yes, let me have this roast beef special. \n#Person1#: You have a choice of vegetables, green peas, lima beans or spinach. \n#Person2#: I will have the green peas and make sure the beef is well done. \n#Person1#: Yes, sir. What would you want to drink, coffee, tea or milk? \n#Person2#: A cup of coffee, please, with cream and sugar. \n#Person1#: The cream and sugar are on the table, sir. \n#Person2#: Oh, yes. \n#Person1#: Would you like to order some dessert? \n#Person2#: What comes with the special? \n#Person1#: Ice cream, fresh fruit or chocolate cake. \n#Person2#: I think I will have a dish of Vanilla ice cream. \n#Person1#: Yes, sir. \n#Person2#: Waiter, may I have my check, please? \n#Person1#: Here you are, sir. Pay the cashier at the door. 
#Person1#: Where's Mrs. Johnson? \n#Person2#: Just call her Lisa, Mary. She's cooking dinner. \n#Person1#: I see. Can I sit down? \n#Person2#: Of course! Make yourself at home. \n#Person1#: Thank you, Mr. Johnson. \n#Person2#: Please, just call me Tom. \n#Person1#: Okay, Tom. \n#Person2#: Where's Cindy? \n#Person1#: She's upstairs in my room. \n#Person2#: Can you tell her to come downstairs? We're about to have dinner. 
#Person1#: Damn it , I'm running out of money again, I really need to balance my budget and handle my money better.\n#Person2#: You did spend too much, and most of the expense was kind of unnecessary. \n#Person1#: But I make it. \n#Person2#: No , you don't have to spend every penny you make , you could save some every month, like a lot of other people do. \n#Person1#: I work hard so I deserve to enjoy, but that costs money. \n#Person2#: You should save in case of an emergency, you need to have more self-control, what things did you spend money on? \n#Person1#: The problem is that I have no idea. I didn't pay attention. \n#Person2#: Let's bygones be bygones, start saving right now. 
#Person1#: Did you read the story in the paper, Robin?\n#Person2#: What story, Grandma?\n#Person1#: Due to lack of money for repainting the building and for the furniture needed, the plans for the community center have been put off.\n#Person2#: Is that a serious problem, Grandma?\n#Person1#: It is. Especially for my friend Nat, he doesn't have any family with him. He lives alone and depends on places like a community center to be with people of his own age.\n#Person2#: But there's the old community center.\n#Person1#: It's small and the problem is that it set up mainly for kids to play. It's too noisy for some older people like Nat.\n#Person2#: I see what you mean now. There is a way, Grandma. You may get your friends to work. I can get some of my friends to go around the neighborhood and collect the furniture.
#Person1#: I have just received a letter from Beck.\n#Person2#: Really? What does he say?\n#Person1#: Beck says that the wheat is ready for harvest, and he's thinking of buying some fields next year.\n#Person2#: Oh, he must be doing the work well.\n#Person1#: Yes, I think he is, he's proud of having the largest farm in Oregon.\n#Person2#: I guess you're looking forward to seeing him.\n#Person1#: You are right. In fact, I'm thinking of visiting him next week. I want to help with the harvest on the farm.\n#Person2#: We really need to have much outdoor exercise. When I was young, I was quite good at farming.\n#Person1#: When I was on the farm in my childhood, I liked watering the flowers, riding horses and feeding the chickens.\n#Person2#: Yes, I like farm work, too. Last time when I was at my brothers. I once tried my hand at milking a cow. It was interesting.
#Person1#: Service is really slow here. I've been trying to get the waiter's attention for 10 minutes.\n#Person2#: I hope he can serve us soon. I'm starving and I have a class at 2 o'clock.\n#Person1#: Me, too. I recognize that you were holding an English book. You must be a student at the English language center.\n#Person2#: Yeah, I'm in the fourth course. Are you studying there, too?\n#Person1#: Yes, I'm in the fifth course. I took the fourth course last month.\n#Person2#: I just came here 2 weeks ago. Do you like the institute?\n#Person1#: It's pretty good. I think I've learned a lot of English so far.\n#Person2#: Yeah, I only wish the classes were a little smaller, because we don't get enough chance to talk. But I like my teachers a lot.
#Person1#: What are you surfing on the internet, John? You are smiling. Are you seeing a film?\n#Person2#: No. You know Christmas Day is coming. I am choosing some lovely cards for my friends.\n#Person1#: You mean you won't buy cards from the shops.\n#Person2#: Mom, it's a new way to express your friendship and love.\n#Person1#: But it seems that you only want to save money.\n#Person2#: Yeah, we can save a lot of paper, if we all do so.\n#Person1#: Sounds reasonable. I mainly send instant messages using my cell phone or write letters.\n#Person2#: Cards on the internet can be matched with lovely pictures and music.\n#Person1#: Wonderful. Let me choose one for your grandma first.
#Person1#: Good morning, native tongue translations. Can I help you?\n#Person2#: Yes, I was wondering how much it would cost to translate a document from English into Arabic?\n#Person1#: Well, it depends on the kind of document how long it is and when you need it returned. We don't do any translations of textbooks.\n#Person2#: It's a cookbook about 20,000 words long. It is not urgent so you can set your own schedule.\n#Person1#: Well, ma'am, Arabic is one of the most difficult languages in the world. And there aren't very many translators compared to say Spanish. In other words, the charge for Arabic translation will be higher than for most other languages.\n#Person2#: I understand, could you give me an estimate?\n#Person1#: For this project, we would charge between 5 and 10 cents per word.\n#Person2#: OK, thanks for your time, I think I will keep looking.
#Person1#: I'm here with Margaret Seabrook, the CEO of creative toys. In today's show, we're going to discuss the hottest new toy of two thousand seventeen, the Super Spinner. Margaret, welcome.\n#Person2#: Thank you, Brian. It's great to be here.\n#Person1#: OK, so tell us about this new toy.\n#Person2#: Well. It's similar to a relaxation ball in its function, but it's useful for anyone who has problems focusing.\n#Person1#: So how does it work?\n#Person2#: It's about the size of a cookie and it has 3 small round parts that can move in any direction. Basically, you just hold it in between your thumb and middle finger and spin it. That's it.\n#Person1#: That's it?\n#Person2#: Yeah, it's very popular. Not only with children, but with adults as well.\n#Person1#: A professor at MIT by the name of Jill Mean Lee has publicly stated there is no scientific or medical evidence for your claims about its benefits. Many schools also have banned the toy, saying it leads to a lack of focus in the classroom.\n#Person2#: Well, that professor is allowed to have her opinion.\n#Person1#: Fair enough, and who invented it?\n#Person2#: Catherine Hettinger, a chemical engineer, was first believed to be its creator. But then we found that an IT professional named Scott McCoskry was the actual inventor.\n#Person1#: It's time for a commercial break. More with Margaret Seabrook in a moment.
#Person1#: I've come to hear about your offer.\n#Person2#: We have the offer ready for you. Let me check. 10 boxes with 50 brooches per box, at 20, 000 yuan ; 20 boxes with 50 waistbands per box, at 30, 000 yuan ; 15 boxes with other ornaments per box, at 7, 500 yuan, for shipment in June. The offer is valid for five days.\n#Person1#: I can tell you right now that your prices are a little higher than we expected.\n#Person2#: You know that the prices of the ornaments have been rising in recent years. The prices we offer this time compare favorably with quotations you can get else where.\n#Person1#: I am afraid I can't agree with you there. I must point out your prices are higher than the quotations we've received from other companies.\n#Person2#: But you must take the design and quality into consideration. You know we are superior to others in design and quality. We have various styles, which the other companies cannot catch up with.\n#Person1#: I agree that yours are of the top.\n#Person2#: Well, since your order is large enough, can you give me a rough idea?\n#Person1#: To have this business concluded, I should say a reduction of least 10 % would help.\n#Person2#: Impossible. How about 5 % off?\n#Person1#: Right. A reduction of 5 % is acceptable.
#Person1#: Did you have any kind of punishment in your life and studies?\n#Person2#: Yes, just once.\n#Person1#: What was the reason?\n#Person2#: I once played truant when I was in college because I intended to organize a donation activity for the disaster-hit areas in Sichuan.
#Person1#: What can I do for you?\n#Person2#: I'd like to buy a keepsake for my girlfriend. Could you make a recommendation for me?\n#Person1#: I'd like to. How do you like the hat?\n#Person2#: It's not special. It can be seen everywhere.\n#Person1#: How about the umbrella? It's made of wood and paper. It's very beautiful.\n#Person2#: It's interesting. Let me see.\n#Person1#: Do you like it?\n#Person2#: Yes, how much is it?\n#Person1#: Fifty yuan.\n#Person2#: OK, I'll take it.
#Person1#: Hi, can I help you?\n#Person2#: No, thanks. I'm just looking.\n#Person1#: All right. If you need any help, just let me know. My name is Greg.\n#Person2#: Sure, I'll let you know if I need anything. Hm, this mattress is very firm. Jack will probably like it.\n#Person1#: Did you find something you like?\n#Person2#: Yes, this mattress is very good. It's pretty firm. The mattress I'm now sleeping on is saggy.\n#Person1#: You are right. This is very good brand. It doesn't sag easily and we offer a lifetime warranty, so you don't have to worry about its quality.\n#Person2#: Does it come with a frame?\n#Person1#: Unfortunately, it doesn't. However we can give you a 10 % discount on the frame. We also offer a very good financing plan. There is no payment no interest until next June.\n#Person2#: That's an attractive plan. I'll think about it.
#Person1#: So who does he think he is, anyway, I can't believe the way that my boss has been ordering everyone around lately, I mean, it's now like he is the CEO, or anything.\n#Person2#: Um. . . Actually I am guessing you didn't get the MEMO. Your boss was selected to fill the vacancy in the CEO slot. He actually is the CEO now, or will be, as soon as the official press releases and hoopla is done with.\n#Person1#: Yikes! you are joking, right? I can't believe it. No wonder he is so stressed and bossy lately. I thought he was just being ostentatious by giving orders to people and all the different departments. What big shoes to fill!\n#Person2#: No kidding! When the last CEO left, we were worried about the future of the company.\n#Person1#: What does a CEO do anyway? I know the CEO makes the most money in the company, but what does he actually do?\n#Person2#: He is responsible to the board of directors for everything that happens in the company. He or she must give leadership to all company officers, as CEO is also responsible for providing the guidance of philosophy of the company, and acting as official representative, or face of the company.\n#Person1#: Must be one smart guy.
#Person1#: I would love to be famous and have thousands of adoring fans.\n#Person2#: Really? I'm not sure that I would like all the attention. There have been numerous cases of paparazzi interfering with star's private live in recent years.\n#Person1#: I love being photographed! If I were famous, I'd do interviews for all the top magazines, like cosmo and elle.\n#Person2#: I wouldn't mind having my photo taken a few times or being interviewed once or twice, but it would get tedious after a while. Imagine the things the gossip columnists would write about you.\n#Person1#: no-one really believes gossip columnists.\n#Person2#: I think you'll find that many people believe what they read in gossip columns. You'd also have to be very careful about every word you said. If you appeared on a chat show and said something silly, it would be reported in all the newspapers and magazines.\n#Person1#: I think you're right about that. I'd need a good manager to be my spokesperson. I could do a lot of charity work, which would help a lot of people.\n#Person2#: That's a great idea. Which charities would you support?\n#Person1#: I love children, as you know, so probably a children's charity.\n#Person2#: You'd have to remember that anything you said or did might reflect on the charity, so you'd really need to be very careful. Anyway, I'd be the first to buy your posters and I'd attend your first book-singing when you wrote your autobiography.\n#Person1#: Thanks, but actually I was hoping I could ask you to write my biography.
#Person1#: Would you like to stretch your legs?\n#Person2#: Why not?\n#Person1#: Let's get a soft drink.\n#Person2#: Do we have enough time?\n#Person1#: Yes, we do.\n#Person2#: The performance is excellent.\n#Person1#: It's a new concert hall and the acoustics are great.\n#Person2#: I couldn't agree more.\n#Person1#: Is this your first time to come to a symphony concert?\n#Person2#: Yes, it is.\n#Person1#: Do you have concert halls in your city?\n#Person2#: Yes, but it's much smaller.\n#Person1#: Well, we'd better get back to our seats. It's about to start.\n#Person2#: OK.
#Person1#: Which film shall we see?\n#Person2#: There is nothing good at the moment. Let's do something different. Would you like to go to a concert?\n#Person1#: Yes, I'd love to. Here is a good one, Mozart and Beethoven. It's on the Festival Hall.\n#Person2#: Fine! Do you want anything to eat now?\n#Person1#: No, I'm not hungry.\n#Person2#: Well, let's go and have something to drink instead. I know a good place. It's a little expensive, but it's fun.
#Person1#: Lousy weather, isn't it?\n#Person2#: It has stopped snowing, but it's even colder.\n#Person1#: Look at the ice there hanging from the eaves.\n#Person2#: And the streets are covered with snow.\n#Person1#: Do you know what the temperature is today?\n#Person2#: I missed today's weather forecast over the TV.\n#Person1#: It feels like ten degrees below zero at least. I don't mind the cold weather but I do hate it when it gets slippery.\n#Person2#: The ice will soon be thick enough for skating. I am so fond of winter sports.\n#Person1#: That's great. Let's go skating together tomorrow.
#Person1#: OK, Ann, you spent quite a bit of time in Australia recently so why don't you talk about that?\n#Person2#: I really liked living in Australia. I was an international student and I studied education at the university of Sydney. And living in Sydney was fantasticbecuase I could go to the beach anytime I wanted and there was a great nightlife in Sydney. There are lots of great clubs. And people were very, very friendly and easy-going and I met a lot of international people in living Sydney.\n#Person1#: Mm-hm. How long were you there?\n#Person2#: I was there for almost a year.\n#Person1#: Oh, OK.\n#Person2#: And I travelled a little bit in Australia. I went up the east coast. Up to Frasier Island. Which is a world heritage site. And I saw dingo running along the beach and sharks in the water. We climbed cliffs and went through a rain forest and went camping and then we went up to the. . . , which is a but north. And the further north you go in Australia, the hotter it gets. So we were able to go swimming in the ocean and I went diving for the first time but it was a little bit risky cause I didn't have a diving license, so I went on an introductory dive and I saw a giant clam that had a really purple spongy inside that I was able to touch and then the clam closed up really quickly.\n#Person1#: So, did you, did you lose your finger?\n#Person2#: Almost.\n#Person1#: Almost. Ah, you're lucky. Um, it's funny, you go in the water and you worry about sharks, but not clams.\n#Person2#: Exactly.\n#Person1#: Will you be going back to Australia soon?\n#Person2#: I'd like to go and live there for at least another year. Probably I'll go back to Sydney or maybe I'll go down to Melbourne because it's a really interesting cultural city. They have lot of museums and parks.
#Person1#: What do you like to do in your spare time?\n#Person2#: I like playing chess.\n#Person1#: Do you have any hobbies besides playing chess?\n#Person2#: I'm afraid not.\n#Person1#: Do you have any hobbies like playing tennis or things like that?\n#Person2#: Oh, yes. I like playing basketball.\n#Person1#: Can you tell me why you like it?\n#Person2#: Because I like the feeling of cooperating with others.
#Person1#: Let me tell you what happened to my homework.\n#Person2#: OK, go ahead--what is the excuse THIS time?\n#Person1#: Actually, I did it, but then it got lost.\n#Person2#: Could you have gotten it done at another time?\n#Person1#: Yes, I could.\n#Person2#: You have never missed an assignment before--when will you be making this one up?\n#Person1#: I'll make it up early next week.\n#Person2#: That would work, but don't let it happen again.\n#Person1#: I'll try.\n#Person2#: That will solve it then. Let's work hard to not let it happen again.
#Person1#: who is your favorite NBA star?\n#Person2#: Kobe Bryant, of course.\n#Person1#: Kobe? I know him, the key guy of the Lakers, a heck of a NBA player. He is on fire when he breaks through enemy defense.\n#Person2#: He is competent both in driving the lane and shooting jumpers, but what really makes him formidable is his ability to switch up and dribble with his left hand.\n#Person1#: Maybe he is not good ay rebounding?\n#Person2#: indeed, no man can be perfect. He is just so-so in crashing the boards. Usually he plays shooting guard. Rebounding might not be his strong suit.\n#Person1#: Kobe came to Beijing during this summer's Olympics. Did you go to the match between China and USA?\n#Person2#: who wouldn't! My friend Lee went so far as to get an autograph from him.\n#Person1#: well then, what are your spoils?\n#Person2#: well, nothing more than a jumble of photographs.
#Person1#: What a good day!\n#Person2#: Yes. It's really wonderful here The grass is greener and the air is fresher than those in the city.\n#Person1#: Right. Let's go out and enjoy the beautiful natural scenery.\n#Person2#: Great, let's go.\n#Person1#: Wow, what a beautiful lake! The green hills and clear water really provide magnificent scenery.\n#Person2#: En, it's so beautiful that I don't want to move my eyes from it.\n#Person1#: I feel as if I'm living in a different world, honey.\n#Person2#: The same to me. All the things here make me happy, the mountain, the water, the grass, the birds, the sunshine. . .\n#Person1#: I think we should go out more frequently. The natural scenery can do us good.\n#Person2#: That's the point. We should walk into the nature and enjoy its beauty whenever we have time.\n#Person1#: Right. The city life has made us tired and out of energy, while the natural world can bring us quite new feelings.
#Person1#: Can you believe me?\n#Person2#: Sure.\n#Person1#: Please count on my love.\n#Person2#: I will.\n#Person1#: I'll be yours through endless time.\n#Person2#: I see. And I'll always be devoted to you.\n#Person1#: Thank you. I know I've nothing to offer you, but I'll never give you reason to cry.\n#Person2#: I'll never hurt you ; I'll never lie.\n#Person1#: My love will grow, like a river to flow.\n#Person2#: It can't be dry, and can't die.\n#Person1#: I don't know whether we are in a dream.\n#Person2#: Aha, Aha. . .
#Person1#: I don't think we've met.\n#Person2#: No, I don't think we have.\n#Person1#: My name is Dick Brown.\n#Person2#: How do you do? Mr. Brown. I am Susan Heywood.\n#Person1#: Mr. Smith often talked about you.\n#Person2#: Really? I am glad to meet you.\n#Person1#: I'm honored to know you.
#Person1#: Bye, mom!\n#Person2#: Wait, Jimmy, it's cold outside. Put a hat on!\n#Person1#: OK. Bye!\n#Person2#: No, wait, you will be too cold without mittens.\n#Person1#: Alright. See ya!\n#Person2#: Hold on, with that wind, you're going to catch a cold. Wear this scarf.\n#Person1#: Ok, see you after school. . .\n#Person2#: Oh. . . and ear muffs! Put these on. . . here we go.\n#Person1#: Mom?\n#Person2#: Yes, honey. . .\n#Person1#: I. . . I can't breathe.
#Person1#: Can you tell me about a nice restaurant to go to?\n#Person2#: Of course! How much would you like to spend on your meal?\n#Person1#: My date is quite sophisticated. She would expect nothing less than the best.\n#Person2#: Well, how about our own hotel restaurant? It's conveniently located and has a three-star rating.\n#Person1#: That's a good idea, except I want to go out, not stay in. Something else, maybe?\n#Person2#: Well, how about Gramercy Tavern? It's a very popular tourist spot, with great food and music.\n#Person1#: That sounds good! Could you call them to see if I can get a reservation?\n#Person2#: Of course, sir. You've made a good choice.
#Person1#: We'Ve got a lot of work to do now, but take your time over this project. We don't want to make any mistakes.\n#Person2#: Ok. I should have it finished by Friday afternoon. Then I can check those account over the weekend. We need to have them finished by Monday, right?\n#Person1#: That's right. We'll finish them just in time. The Macy project can wait for the time being. We need to spend several days on that project, but it isn't due to be finished until the end of the month, so we have plenty of time to get it done.\n#Person2#: Some next week on, we should be in less of a rush.\n#Person1#: I'm going to give everyone on the team an extra day off. Everyone deserves it.\n#Person2#: Don't say that yet. A new project could suddenly appear.\n#Person1#: That's true. Right. I'm going back to the meeting. It's been going on for hours and there's no indication that it'll end soon.\n#Person2#: Carol said that she would spend some time checking that everyone is up-to-date with their work.\n#Person1#: Good. I have to go right now. I really hope this meeting doesn't last too long.\n#Person2#: They usually go on for ages.\n#Person1#: I'll stop by if I have time later. Make sure everyone knows that we must stick to the deadlines.\n#Person2#: I will. Enjoy your meeting!
#Person1#: He has come to life in the end.\n#Person2#: Oh, thank God. We all felt frightened by the bad new about him.\n#Person1#: Yes. Fortunately, an ambulance passed in the nick of time, and we got him away to hospital.\n#Person2#: Right. Unless, who know what will happen.\n#Person1#: Wish him to be healthy soon.
#Person1#: Hello, Sir. We haven't seen you for quite a while. So, what is it today that we can do for you?\n#Person2#: I need a Deposit Certificate to handle some stuff in land.\n#Person1#: I see, yes, I can do that now. I'm sure you know, as I may have told you before, you should pay an extra 20 RMB handling fee for this service.\n#Person2#: Yes, I recalled you charging that before. And I thought it was extortionate! Haha!\n#Person1#: I can just take it from your account, you don't need to give me cash.\n#Person2#: OK. . . so it'll come out of my account? Well, that makes it much easier.\n#Person1#: Anything else you'll be needing today, Sir?\n#Person2#: Nope. That's everything, thanks.
#Person1#: Excuse me!\n#Person2#: May I help you?\n#Person1#: Yes, I'd like to send this book to France.\n#Person2#: Let me weight it first. That'll be 14 dollars.\n#Person1#: Can it go in an envelop?\n#Person2#: Of course, it's 4 dollars now.\n#Person1#: Do I need stamps?\n#Person2#: No, you don't. We use computers now.\n#Person1#: When will it arrive?\n#Person2#: In a month.

#Person1#: Excuse me, doc. I am not feeling well. Can you help me?\n#Person2#: Yes, but not here. Have you got registered yet?\n#Person1#: No, I haven't. Where do I go for that?\n#Person2#: The registration office. Did you bring your records with you?\n#Person1#: Yes.\n#Person2#: Is anybody here with you? Parents or siblings?\n#Person1#: No, I'm here all by myself.\n#Person2#: You are a brave kid. Go ahead to the registration office first, then to the doctors.\n#Person1#: But I don't know where the registration office is.\n#Person2#: It's in the hall on the first floor.\n#Person1#: Do I have to come back here after getting registered?\n#Person2#: No, kid. This is the gynecology department.\n#Person1#: Gynecology?\n#Person2#: Yeah, It's only for girls.
#Person1#: I opened my mail, found this eviction notice, and don't know what to do with it.\n#Person2#: Actually, it is a 30 - day notice to vacate the premises.\n#Person1#: Just for being a few days late?\n#Person2#: This isn't the first time you have been considerably late with the rent. I need to start the procedure to evict you.\n#Person1#: Are you taking my apartment away?\n#Person2#: This is a notice to inform you that the sheriff will evict you in 30 days if you do not pay up on your rent.\n#Person1#: Can I keep the apartment if I pay my rent in full?\n#Person2#: You can keep the apartment if you stay caught up on your rent.

#Person1#: How do you like skiing, Pat?\n#Person2#: I love it. All my life I wanted to learn to ski. Finally I took lessons last year.\n#Person1#: I suppose skiing is easy for you.\n#Person2#: No, quite the opposite. I thought I'd never stop falling down. Then all of a sudden I started skiing much better.\n#Person1#: I see. Do you ski often?\n#Person2#: Every chance I get. On weekends I ski all day long. Sometimes I even ski at night.\n#Person1#: That sounds great.\n#Person2#: Oh, yes. The ski slopes are well lit. It's really nice to ski at night. Why don't you learn to ski?\n#Person1#: Not on your life! I know I'd break my leg\n#Person2#: Don't be so frightened. It's just a skill.
#Person1#: I hear you bought a new house in the northern suburbs.\n#Person2#: That's right, we bought it the same day we came on the market.\n#Person1#: What kind of house is it?\n#Person2#: It's a wonderful Spanish style.\n#Person1#: Oh, I love the roof tiles on Spanish style houses.\n#Person2#: And it's a bargaining. A house like this in river side costs double the price.\n#Person1#: Great, is it a two bedroom house?\n#Person2#: No, it has three bedrooms and three beds, and has a living room with a twelve-foot ceiling. There's a two-car garage.\n#Person1#: That's a nice area too. It'll be a good investment for you.\n#Person2#: Yeas, when will you buy a house?\n#Person1#: Not untill the end of this year, you know, just before my wedding.\n#Person2#: Right, congratulations.\n#Person1#: Thank you.
#Person1#: Hello! How do I get online with my laptop?\n#Person2#: Just plug the Ethernet cable into your computer, and you'll be online in a heartbeat.\n#Person1#: Well, I see the cable. But my computer runs on wireless only.\n#Person2#: No problem. I'll tell you about our alternatives.\n#Person1#: Yes, I'd love to hear what the alternatives are.\n#Person2#: Our state-of-the-art computer lab is on the first floor.\n#Person1#: Great! But is it free?\n#Person2#: Sir, the computers are free to guests, but you do have to pay a nominal printing fee.\n#Person1#: You said there were other alternatives?\n#Person2#: Just use your computer here in the lobby. It's set up for wireless.\n#Person1#: Okay. That sounds like a winner. Now if I need to print something in the lobby?\n#Person2#: We might have a printer here next month. But for now, you'll have to go to the lab.
#Person1#: Good morning. What seems to be the problem?\n#Person2#: Good morning, doctor. I feel terrible. I'Ve god a cold and I have a rash here on my neck. I'm not sleeping well either. What do you think the problem could be?\n#Person1#: I'd say you'Ve been working too hard or are under stress for some reason. Have you been taking anything for your cold?\n#Person2#: Yes, I bought some medicine at the chemist's. I'Ve been taking it for three days.\n#Person1#: Good. I'm going to prescribe something stronger. It will make you feel drowsy, so you certainly should rest.\n#Person2#: OK. I can afford to take a few days off work.\n#Person1#: Have you been working hard recently?\n#Person2#: Yes, I have. I had to get a project finished. It's done now, so I can relax a little.\n#Person1#: Good. Let's take a look at that rash. . . it looks worse than it is. I'm going to prescribe some ointment for it. If the rash doesn't clear up in a few days, come back and see me. Do you have any other symptoms?\n#Person2#: I have a bad headache, but. . .\n#Person1#: Don't worry about that. It's probably of the stress you'Ve been under. Just take some aspirin. Combined with the stronger cough medicine, it will make you feel very tired. You shouldn't work or use any equipment which requires concentration. If I were you, I'd just sleep, read a book, or watch TV. Here is your prescription.\n#Person2#: Thanks doctor. I'll get these immediately. Goodbye.
#Person1#: It's time to graduate and it's time to find a job. Susan, why do we need to find a job?\n#Person2#: We need to work is because we need money to live. We need money for food and clothes and to pay for house. We need money for many different things, and only when we work, we can earn money. And work can also help us feel that we are useful.\n#Person1#: But you know it's hard for a new graduate to find a god job right now.\n#Person2#: Yes, it is really hard. But you must believe that you will find a suitable job finally. When you work, you can accumulate a lot of experience. Besides, you need to learn a lot of things while you are working.\n#Person1#: I've been fed up with study.\n#Person2#: But whether you like it or not, there's a trend of life-long study to make sure that we can keep ourselves up with the high developing society. And you need to accept this concept positively.\n#Person1#: Oh, my. Why there are still so many things to learn after graduation?\n#Person2#: You have no choice, so you'd better adjust your thoughts to be ready to learn anything at any time.
#Person1#: Can you tell me what the unit price of such carpet is?\n#Person2#: Of course, here is the catalogue and the price list. You can have a look. We also have many other kinds of carpets.\n#Person1#: The price seems acceptable for me. But I want to check whether you can supply the carpets now if we order some?\n#Person2#: Of course we can. We can provide the quantity you ask for.\n#Person1#: That's very good. Shall we sign a contract now?\n#Person2#: No problem. Let's check the terms of contract.
#Person1#: Hello. May I help you?\n#Person2#: Yes, please. I've been here for nearly two months, but I still haven't found a job. Do you think you can find one for me?\n#Person1#: Don't worry, we'll try to help you. Will you please fill out this form?\n#Person2#: What's this form for?\n#Person1#: This is for registration. After you have given us your personal details, we'll match these against new jobs as they come in. And we'll contact you when there is a job that suits you.\n#Person2#: That's great. But how long do I have to wait?\n#Person1#: Maybe several weeks, maybe several months. It's hard to tell.\n#Person2#: Oh, dear. How can I wait for such a long time?\n#Person1#: Actually, many jobs are filled by people who select vacancies from the display boards there.\n#Person2#: Then, what do you think I should do?\n#Person1#: My advice is to keep looking for jobs yourself. Check the job boards at the job center regularly and check the newspapers daily. If you have friends or relatives here, ask them for help, too.\n#Person2#: I see. Thank you very much for your advice. Bye.\n#Person1#: Keep in touch.
#Person1#: What can I offer you here?\n#Person2#: I came here to ask for some information.\n#Person1#: Ok. Please go ahead.\n#Person2#: I bought a pair of trousers last year, which I like the best. But this year they don't fit me very well. They're tight in the waist, baggy at the knees. Can you make some alterations?\n#Person1#: Oh, we are skillful in doing that. You can trust us. Our shop has a history of more than 20 years.\n#Person2#: It seems I find the right place.\n#Person1#: Yes, absolutely! We have a very good reputation in the neighborhood.\n#Person2#: When can I have my trousers if I bring it to you tomorrow?\n#Person1#: If you like you can wait here. They will be ready in one hour and a half.\n#Person2#: All right. See you tomorrow.
#Person1#: But what if I don't win what I bid on?\n#Person2#: Then it wasn't meant to be. Some people have put up a hard fight for some items I bid on. But I was the sole bidder for this bag and got it dirt-cheap.\n#Person1#: It seems that you can e-mail the seller and ask questions.\n#Person2#: Sure. I've even e-mailed some people who had bought from the person who sold this bag.\n#Person1#: And people are honest?\n#Person2#: They said he was an honest and professional businessman. But that's the exciting part. It's kind of like gambling. . .
#Person1#: Are you sure you know where this bus goes?\n#Person2#: It should go to Altadena.\n#Person1#: What do you mean it should?\n#Person2#: I'm not completely sure if it really does.\n#Person1#: Dude, are we on the right bus?\n#Person2#: I'm almost positive that this is the right one.\n#Person1#: It doesn't look like we're on our way to Altadena.\n#Person2#: We have been riding this bus for a long time.\n#Person1#: What does that sign say?\n#Person2#: I think it says Temple City.\n#Person1#: Yup, I'm never trusting you with the bus schedules again.\n#Person2#: I'm sorry. But at least we know which bus to catch to get back where we started.\n#Person1#: Yeah, at least.
#Person1#: That's it! I've had it with this TV! We need to get a new one. The signal is so bad. It's ridiculous. All of our friends have nice TVs. It's high time we joined them.\n#Person2#: You don't want to get one of those 3D TVs, do you?\n#Person1#: Well, I'm not sure. All I know is that I want something with a big screen,and the most important thing is a clear picture.\n#Person2#: Oh, you mean like the one our neighbor bought the other day?\n#Person1#: Yeah. They have fantastic sound, too.\n#Person2#: This all sounds a little expensive to me. I'm not sure if we have the money, even if we didn't go on vacation.\n#Person1#: Hey, look at this ad in the paper! They're having a special sale on TVs. This one is only $300! And even the biggest ones are only $500.\n#Person2#: Well, I think we can afford that. Let's go check out that sale!
#Person1#: Hello, Robert speaking.\n#Person2#: Hi, it's Emma. I'm glad you're there. It's about our appointment on Wednesday morning. I'm afraid I can't make it now.\n#Person1#: Oh, that's a shame.\n#Person2#: I'm sorry. There was a change in my business partner's plan. And Wednesday is the only day she is able to see me.\n#Person1#: That's okay. But we need to find another date.\n#Person2#: I could manage sometime Thursday. How about you?\n#Person1#: Sorry, I got an important meeting all day. What about Friday?\n#Person2#: I'll go to an exhibition in the morning, but I could come to your office after that.\n#Person1#: Great! Look forward to seeing you then. Bye!
#Person1#: Hello, Mr. Tompkins. Our newspaper is going to print an article about new products. Could you tell me about the new home your company has built? I understand it promises to be a model for the houses of the future.\n#Person2#: Certainly. The idea is not to have a house full of different things. This is a complete home system. It will make people's lives easier.\n#Person1#: OK! So tell me how this house will make my life easier?\n#Person2#: When you arrive at the front door, you won't need a key. The door will open with a touch of your finger. You'll be able to call your refrigerator when you're at the grocery store and find out how much you need to buy. Isn't it wonderful?\n#Person1#: Can I call the washing machine as well?\n#Person2#: Sure. But you won't need to. The house comes with a robot. It is programmed to clean the house and do the washing.\n#Person1#: What does it cost?\n#Person2#: A million dollars.\n#Person1#: A million dollars! It will be the 22nd century before I can afford to buy one!
#Person1#: English Language Center. How may I help you?\n#Person2#: Yes. I'm calling to find out more information about your program. For example, what kind of courses do you offer?\n#Person1#: Well, first of all, the purpose of our program is to provide language learning opportunities to this area's community [Uh-hum], whether a student's goal is to master basic functional language skills, let's say, for his or her job, or to study intensively to enter a US college or university.\n#Person2#: Okay. I'm calling for a friend who is interested in attending a US university.\n#Person1#: And that's the kind of, uh, instruction that we provide, from basic communication courses to content-based classes such as computer literacy, intercultural communication, and business English.\n#Person2#: Great. What are your application deadlines for the next semester?\n#Person1#: Well, we ask applicants to apply no later than two months before the semester begins. [Uh-hum] This gives us time to process the application and issue the student's I-20.\n#Person2#: An I-20?\n#Person1#: Oh, an I-20 is a form that indicates that we are giving permission for the student to study in our program, and then the student takes this form to the US embassy in his or her country to apply for the F-1 student visa.\n#Person2#: Alright. What is the tuition for a full-time student?\n#Person1#: It's two thousand thirty dollars.\n#Person2#: And how does one apply?\n#Person1#: Well, we can send you an application and you can mail it back to us, or you can fill out our application that's online at our Web site.\n#Person2#: And are there other materials I would need to send in addition to the application form?\n#Person1#: Uh, yes. You would need to send in a $35 non-refundable application fee [Uh-huh], a sponsorship form indicating who will be responsible financially for the student while studying in our program, and a bank statement showing that you or your sponsor has sufficient funds to cover tuition expenses and living costs for the entire year of study.\n#Person2#: And how can I send these materials to you?\n#Person1#: You can either send the application packet by regular mail or you can fax it.\n#Person2#: And the application fee?\n#Person1#: We accept money orders, travelers checks, or credit cards.\n#Person2#: Alright. I think that's about it.\n#Person1#: Okay great.\n#Person2#: Oh and what is your name?\n#Person1#: Ok. My name is Tony Nelson. You can just call and ask for me.\n#Person2#: Great. Thank you for help.\n#Person1#: No problem and please don't hesitate to call again if you have any other questions.\n#Person2#: Okay. Goodbye.
#Person1#: I've gotta hand it to you, you really did a good job! \n#Person2#: So glad that you think so! \n#Person1#: I think you deserve a promotion. \n#Person2#: Oh, really? Thanks a lot... well, I still have a lot to learn, I guess. 
#Person1#: Look! This place is so big. \n#Person2#: It has to be. Soccer is the number one sport throughout Europe. In the States we have the Big Three, baseball, football and basketball, but there is only the Big One here in Europe, soccer. \n#Person1#: Can you play soccer, John? \n#Person2#: I never have. I think my high school had a team, but I went out for baseball. Did you join any sports teams in school, Lily? \n#Person1#: In high school, I went out for track for 400 meter and 800 meter runs. \n#Person2#: Wow, those are races. \n#Person1#: Yeah. That's probably why I didn't do very well at them. Were you a good baseball player? \n#Person2#: I was so so. Anyways, let's exercise a little. 
#Person1#: Have you had any kind of punishment in your college? \n#Person2#: Yes, but it was many years ago. \n#Person1#: What was it for? \n#Person2#: I was a naughty boy and I played hooky. So the school gave me a punishment to clear the classroom for a week. 
#Person1#: I hear you and James are engaged at last. \n#Person2#: Yes, we are. \n#Person1#: When are you getting married? \n#Person2#: In the spring. \n#Person1#: Oh, lovely. Where's the wedding going to be? \n#Person2#: Well. . we're not sure yet, probably in St. Albans. \n#Person1#: Oh, yes, your parents live there, don't they? \n#Person2#: Yes, that's right. \n#Person1#: Where are you going to live after you're married? \n#Person2#: We're going to buy a flat or a small house somewhere in South London. \n#Person1#: Are you going to give up your job? \n#Person2#: Yes, probably but I may look for another one when we're settled in. 
#Person1#: I have had some really horrible headaches lately. \n#Person2#: How long have your headaches been going on? \n#Person1#: I get headaches occasionally, but they have been really bad lately. \n#Person2#: Any unusual amounts of stress in your life going on right now? \n#Person1#: I am getting ready to take my GRE. \n#Person2#: Have you been able to sleep regular hours? \n#Person1#: It has been hard for me to sleep with a bad headache. \n#Person2#: Has anything hit you in the head lately? \n#Person1#: I hit my head on a cupboard door a week ago. \n#Person2#: Let's have you come back in a few days and see how you feel. 
#Person1#: May I take your order now? \n#Person2#: Yes, please. What's special today? Any special recommendations? \n#Person1#: Certainly. I would recommend 'Songshuguiyu'. \n#Person2#: The name sounds fascinating. What is it exactly? \n#Person1#: Well, it is sweet and sour fried Mandarin fish. \n#Person2#: Sorry, I'm not interested in vinegar. \n#Person1#: Then, how about this one? \n#Person2#: OK. I'll have that. \n#Person1#: Very good. Could I serve you anything else? \n#Person2#: Thank you. That's enough. \n#Person1#: My pleasure. Just a little while, your order will be ready very soon. Please enjoy your lunch. \n#Person2#: Thanks. 
#Person1#: Did you get the injury playing football, Jim?\n#Person2#: Yes, one of the boys kicked my foot instead of the ball.\n#Person1#: The best thing for you to do is to rest your leg for 48 hours.\n#Person2#: When can I go back to school?\n#Person1#: You can go back in 4 days. But you'll need to avoid sports for a month.
#Person1#: Nancy what's wrong with you? You look up it down.\n#Person2#: Yes, my credit card bill has just arrived. I'm in debt now.\n#Person1#: Well. How much have you overdrawn last month?\n#Person2#: 3000 yuan.\n#Person1#: 3000 yuan? You have over spent too much.\n#Person2#: I have no other choice. 2 friends of mine held birthday parties last month. I spent a lot on the birthday presents.\n#Person1#: What about the rest?\n#Person2#: Well, some was spent on get-together parties with friends. Some on make up, some on clothes and some on food.\n#Person1#: You better change your consumption habit. Otherwise, you will get into the financial trouble soon.\n#Person2#: I think so.
#Person1#: Excuse me, sir. Do you still have an apartment left?\n#Person2#: Yes, there is still a one bedroom-apartment left. Do you want to rent it?\n#Person1#: Yes, but do you rent rooms by the week? I only want to rent the apartment for 2 weeks. I'm not staying here for long.\n#Person2#: Yes, but you need to pay $60.00 a week and the rent is just $200 a month.\n#Person1#: That's fine with me. Can I move in today?\n#Person2#: Sure, the apartment is just a 5 minute walk away from here. Now I'll show you to it.\n#Person1#: Thanks.
#Person1#: You look a little uncomfortable. What's the matter?\n#Person2#: Oh, I just don't eat Thai food very much.\n#Person1#: Would you like me to order you something else or would you rather go to that new Italian restaurant?\n#Person2#: No, we came here to eat, so let's eat. Maybe I'll just add some salt.\n#Person1#: Really? It's no problem. I don't want you to feel forced into eating something you don't like.\n#Person2#: It's fine really. I need to try new things.
#Person1#: Hey Tina, how's the Spanish course going?\n#Person2#: Tough, our teacher is using a lot of authentic material. You know, stuff, off the radio and TV. He even tapes conversations with his friends and uses them in class.\n#Person1#: So, what are some of the things that make it difficult?\n#Person2#: Well, the speed for a start.\n#Person1#: What do you mean?\n#Person2#: You know, they just talk so fast. I can't understand every word.\n#Person1#: Maybe you shouldn't try?\n#Person2#: What do you mean?\n#Person1#: Well, maybe you should just listen to the keywords, you know, the most important words.\n#Person2#: But how do I know what they are?\n#Person1#: Well, there usually the words with the most stress.
#Person1#: A :: You must be Wily. It's nice to meet you.\n#Person2#: B :: Nice to meet you, Mr. Wilson.\n#Person1#: A :: Tim, please. Please be seated.\n#Person2#: B :: Thank you.\n#Person1#: A :: So, Wily, you have been with IBM for two years, ready for change?\n#Person2#: B :: Well, I think I'm ready for new challenges.
#Person1#: What can I do for you today?\n#Person2#: I have a question.\n#Person1#: What do you need to know?\n#Person2#: I need to take the driver's course. How many hours do I need?\n#Person1#: It depends on what you're trying to do with the completion of the course.\n#Person2#: I need to get my license.\n#Person1#: You're going to need to complete six hours.\n#Person2#: How many hours a day can I do?\n#Person1#: You can do two hours a day for three days.\n#Person2#: That's all I need to do to finish?\n#Person1#: Yes, that's all you need to do.\n#Person2#: Thanks. I'll get back to you.
#Person1#: I need a taxi, please.\n#Person2#: We have various transportation services. Would you prefer a private vehicle?\n#Person1#: No, thanks. A taxi is just fine.\n#Person2#: May I suggest a limo? It's nice to pamper yourself.\n#Person1#: I don't want anything except a taxi, thank you.\n#Person2#: I understand. And where will you be going?\n#Person1#: Rockefeller Center.\n#Person2#: And what time would you like to be picked up?\n#Person1#: The sooner the better.\n#Person2#: A taxi will be here shortly, sir.\n#Person1#: Great! And remember, a taxi, not a limo.\n#Person2#: A taxi it is, sir.
#Person1#: What's wrong with you? You look pale.\n#Person2#: I'm not sure, I feel hot and cold.\n#Person1#: When did the trouble start?\n#Person2#: I was sick most of the night.\n#Person1#: It sounds like you are coming down with the flu. Let me take your temperature.\n#Person2#: Have I got a high fever?\n#Person1#: Yes, thirty-eight point seven. Do you have a headache, chest or throat pain?\n#Person2#: Yes, I have.\n#Person1#: Now, let me have a look at you. I'd like to listen to your chest. Now breathe in, a deep breath, that's it Cough, now again. I want to examine your throat, too. Open wide, say ' Ah - - '\n#Person2#: Aaaaahh, aaaaahh.\n#Person1#: Yes, it does look a bit sore. Let's take an X-ray of your chest and give you a few tests.\n#Person2#: All right, thanks.\n#Person1#: The tests showed nothing wrong. A slight viral infection.\n#Person2#: What shall I do today?\n#Person1#: I'm giving you some antibiotics and aspirins. Take an aspirin when you've got a fever, and take one antibiotic capsule every four hours, and go home and rest in bed for two days. Drink plenty of water, then you'll feel better. Here's the prescription.
#Person1#: Hello.\n#Person2#: Good morning, Ruth. Did I wake you up?\n#Person1#: No, I was just about to get up. What's up, Carl?\n#Person2#: Listen, I am calling to confirm what you said yesterday. Are we supposed to meet at the Chinatown terminal of the Avenue B bus or D bus?\n#Person1#: B as in boy. You should get off at the last stop in Chinatown.\n#Person2#: Oh, you mean Canal Street?\n#Person1#: That's the wrong direction. Canal Street is on the other side of Chinatown.\n#Person2#: Oh, I get it. When did we decide to meet?\n#Person1#: At 10, 45. Is Ann coming along?\n#Person2#: I cannot get hold of her yet.\n#Person1#: See you around, Carl.\n#Person2#: See you later.
#Person1#: Doris, I'm glad you're home. I'm terrified. I don't know what to do!\n#Person2#: What is it? What happened?\n#Person1#: I think someone is stalking me.\n#Person2#: No, it can't be. Really? Who?\n#Person1#: I don't know. I saw him the first time Tuesday. He was at the cafe. I noticed he was looking at me a lot. Not just the usual looking, but staring. He just kept staring at me. He didn't stop.\n#Person2#: What did you do?\n#Person1#: I didn't do anything. Finally, he left. But then I saw him again today. Outside the shoe store. Near the cafe. I went into a CD store and pretended I was looking at CD's. But then he came in too.\n#Person2#: Did he leave when you left?\n#Person1#: Yes. Then I noticed he was on the sidewalk behind me. He was following me.\n#Person2#: What did you do?
#Person1#: Good morning. Mrs. Smith.\n#Person2#: Good morning! Can you help me, please? I'm looking for some books for my mother.\n#Person1#: Well, what kind of books does she like?\n#Person2#: She's very fond of detective stories?\n#Person1#: I see. Has she read any detective stories?\n#Person2#: Oh, yes!\n#Person1#: Do you know if she's read this one?\n#Person2#: I'm not sure, but she probably won't remember if she has! She's very forgetful!\n#Person1#: Ah! She has a bad memory. How old is she?\n#Person2#: She's eighty-seven.\n#Person1#: I suggest you take this book. It's very exciting.\n#Person2#: Thank you. That's a good idea. she likes exciting books. Can you suggest another one?
#Person1#: What can I do for you?\n#Person2#: I have a problem with this check.\n#Person1#: What's wrong?\n#Person2#: I wrote out a check for $ 100 and it bounced.\n#Person1#: Do you have enough money in your checking account?\n#Person2#: I believe so.\n#Person1#: Give me a moment, and I'll check.\n#Person2#: All right. Thanks.\n#Person1#: You only have $ 57 left in your checking account.\n#Person2#: That's impossible.\n#Person1#: I'm sorry, but that's what our records show.\n#Person2#: Okay. Thanks. Have a nice day.
#Person1#: Good morning, I am Monica. Are you Mr. White, the manager of finance department? I am the newcomer and also working in the finance department.\n#Person2#: Yes, that is me. Nice to meet you, Monica. Welcome on board!\n#Person1#: Thank you. I am very happy to have my own office now. I'Ve never had one before. It is very nice.\n#Person2#: Well, we have nicer things than that in this company. You will find out soon.\n#Person1#: Really? What could that be?\n#Person2#: Well, I bet you will love them too. If you need help, just ask me any time. I am in the next door. You can also reach me through the extension 508.\n#Person1#: That is very kind of you. Thank you very much.
#Person1#: You must be pretty excited about your trip to Europe. When is it that you are leaving?\n#Person2#: In just three weeks, and I am excited. But there are still a few things I need to do before I go.\n#Person1#: Like what?\n#Person2#: Like renewing my passport, going to the travel agency to buy my plane ticket and figuring out what to do with my apartment while I'm gone.\n#Person1#: You are not going to give it up, are you?\n#Person2#: No way. I'll never find another apartment around here. But I don't like the idea of paying three months'rent on an empty apartment, either.\n#Person1#: I don't blame you. Perhaps you could sublet it.\n#Person2#: Yes, but whom to?\n#Person1#: Mmm. . . let me think. Oh, I know just a person. An old colleague of mine, Jim Thomas, is coming here to do some research this summer, from June to August.\n#Person2#: That's exactly when I'll be away. It sounds ideal, as long as the landlord agrees.\n#Person1#: Tell you what, I'll be calling Jim late this week anyway, so I'll mention it to him then.\n#Person2#: Well, thanks, Bill. Let me know what happens. That extra money will really come in handy.
#Person1#: Ah, Michelle, hi. I was hoping to see you. How have you been? How's the family?\n#Person2#: Oh, hello, Mr. Campbell. I'm fine and Jack's doing well. How are you?\n#Person1#: I'm fine thanks. I got your report this morning. Thank's for that. Are you joining the conference today?\n#Person2#: Yes, I'm leaving at four pm.\n#Person1#: Good, well we can discuss this more then, but I think the figures are looking very good for this quarter.\n#Person2#: Yes, me too.\n#Person1#: I'm planning to discuss the advertising budget at the conference. I don't think we should continue with the TV advertising.
#Person1#: What did you say when she told you the news?\n#Person2#: I calmed up. And finally, I asked her to chew the cud for such an important decision. I could not have the heart to disappoint her with a blunt refusal.\n#Person1#: But I put my foot down and insisted on her forgetting that.\n#Person2#: How could have the heart to do that? She needs warmth and help.
#Person1#: You look like being on cloud nine.\n#Person2#: I am.\n#Person1#: What has made you so happy?\n#Person2#: I think I'm in love.\n#Person1#: Are you? Who's the lucky girl?\n#Person2#: Her name is Jenny.\n#Person1#: How did you meet her?\n#Person2#: We are in the same math class. Our teacher sat us next to each other.\n#Person1#: What do you like best about her?\n#Person2#: She's very funny. She makes me laugh all the time.\n#Person1#: I guess it was fate working to bring you together.\n#Person2#: Whatever brought us together, I'm happy.
#Person1#: I have some good news for you.\n#Person2#: What's that?\n#Person1#: Jenny is getting married.\n#Person2#: Great! Who's the bridegroom?\n#Person1#: Tom, that lucky guy.\n#Person2#: The guy always hands the girls in a line. When did he propose?\n#Person1#: Last week, It said that he fell in love with Jenny at Mrs. Whit's party last Monday as soon as he saw her.\n#Person2#: My gosh! How romantic! When's the big day?\n#Person1#: July 4, the National Holiday.\n#Person2#: Will it be a church wedding or a civil ceremony?\n#Person1#: Jenny plans to hold it in church.\n#Person2#: Who is the best man?\n#Person1#: Guess!\n#Person2#: Nobody is OK, but you!\n#Person1#: You know, Tom is my best friend and he asked me to be his best man.\n#Person2#: Did you promise him?\n#Person1#: Yes, I did.
#Person1#: It rumored that Jean is fooling around with another woman's husband.\n#Person2#: You gossip! What's the basis of your opinion?\n#Person1#: Someone declared that he saw it.\n#Person2#: I don't believe it. Jean is such a kind lady. How could she do this?\n#Person1#: Who knows? You can't judge a book by its cover.\n#Person2#: Maybe!
#Person1#: not a single email until now? it's already twelve o'clock. I can't believe it!\n#Person2#: can't bear it, right? I've been there before. I'll feel comfortable if no one calls me or sends me text messages, like there is something missing.\n#Person1#: yeah, that's right. If no one sends me test messages, I'll go crazy.\n#Person2#: actually, this is a kind of addiction called ' infomania ' or ' information overload '.\n#Person1#: addiction? checking emails and text messages often can be called an addiction? no way!\n#Person2#: yes, it is. Do you consider a frequent check of your income emails to be an integral part of your working day?\n#Person1#: absolutely.\n#Person2#: do you have your cell phone with you wherever you go and check text messages and phone calls from time to time?\n#Person1#: yeah, it's a must. Otherwise, I may miss important phone calls and text messages.\n#Person2#: do you open all your IM tools whenever you're using a computer?\n#Person1#: yes. MSN, QQ, Skype, Google Talk, Ali wangwang, everything, so that I'll be in touch with all friends and relatives.\n#Person2#: now I can tell you're definitely addicted to the overflow of information.
#Person1#: Excuse me. I've been waiting here for 15 mins. Do you know how often does No. 3 run?\n#Person2#: Oh, it runs every 20 mins. You must have missed it, when you came here. It should be here any minute now.\n#Person1#: It seems that you have got here at a good time. Do you have a bus schedule?\n#Person2#: Yes, I do. You can go to the Transport Department to get yourself a bus schedule and a bus route map.\n#Person1#: I see, thank you.
#Person1#: Hello, sir. Is there anything I can help you find?\n#Person2#: Um. . . Uh. . . I'm just looking, thanks.\n#Person1#: Need a gift for your girlfriend or wife?\n#Person2#: No, no, no. I'm just browsing. Thanks anyway.\n#Person1#: Well, if you need anything, just ask.\n#Person2#: Um. . . well, where's the men's shoe department?\n#Person1#: It's on the third floor. Turn left when you get off the escalator.
#Person1#: I'm so hungry. Shall we go eat now, Rick?\n#Person2#: Sure. Where do you want to go? Are you in the mood for anything in particular?\n#Person1#: How about some dumplings? I just can't get enough of them.\n#Person2#: Dumplings again? ! Oh, Amy, let's try something new!\n#Person1#: Well, what do you have in mind?\n#Person2#: How about the Mongolian hot pot?\n#Person1#: Oh, it's too spicy for me. Don't you remember last time when I tasted the lamb? It Was so spicy my eyes teared up!\n#Person2#: Maybe we can try'Yuanyang pot'this time. You can choose the non-spicy soup base.\n#Person1#: Sounds great. Do they serve noodles? I am in the mood for some tasty noodles as well.\n#Person2#: Yes. The sliced noodles they offer are among the most authentic Shanti cuisines.\n#Person1#: Great. Let's go!\n#Person2#: Wait a minute. Let me throw on a sweater.
#Person1#: Are things still going badly with your houseguest?\n#Person2#: Getting worse. Now he's eating me out of house and home. I'Ve tried talking to him but it all goes in one ear and out the other. He makes himself at home, which is fine. But what really gets me is that yesterday he walked into the living room in the raw and I had company over! That was the last straw.\n#Person1#: Leo, I really think you're beating around the bush with this guy. I know he used to be your best friend in college, but I really think it's time to lay down the law.\n#Person2#: You're right. Everything is probably going to come to a head tonight. I'll keep you informed.
#Person1#: What is my schedule for today, Miss Liu?\n#Person2#: Yes, you are supposed to meet the president at ten fifteen this morning. Then, you have a lunch appointment with Mr. Clark. And this afternoon at three you are scheduled to speak before a group of seminar participants.\n#Person1#: Do you have the meeting report ready?\n#Person2#: Certainly.
#Person1#: Excuse me, would you like to be our guide?\n#Person2#: Of course.\n#Person1#: It's our first time to be here, so would you please arrange a schedule for us?\n#Person2#: With pleasure. I think we should go to the palace first.\n#Person1#: When was the palace built?
#Person1#: Is there anything I can do for you?\n#Person2#: I'm trying to choose a gift.\n#Person1#: Did you have anything particular in mind?\n#Person2#: No, but I'd like to get something typical in this region.\n#Person1#: Well, we have some handmade products. Let me show you some.\n#Person2#: They're quite nice. But I'm afraid they're quite a bit expensive.\n#Person1#: About how much were you planning to spend?\n#Person2#: No more than one hundred yuan.\n#Person1#: Oh, in that case. This one is OK.\n#Person2#: Oh! It's perfect. I think I'll take it. Would you wrap it, please?\n#Person1#: OK. Wait for a moment, please.
#Person1#: I can't find my glasses and I can't see anything. Can you help me find a few things?\n#Person2#: No problem. What are you looking for?\n#Person1#: My laptop, do you see it?\n#Person2#: Yes, your laptop is on the chair.\n#Person1#: Where's my book?\n#Person2#: Which one?\n#Person1#: The dictionary.\n#Person2#: It's under the table.\n#Person1#: Where's my pencil?\n#Person2#: There's a pencil in front of the lamp.\n#Person1#: That's not a pencil. That's a pen.\n#Person2#: Oh, sorry. There is a pencil behind the cup.\n#Person1#: How about my backpack? Do you know where that is?\n#Person2#: It's in between the wall and the bed.\n#Person1#: Where are my shoes?\n#Person2#: They're on the left side of the TV.\n#Person1#: I don't see them.\n#Person2#: Sorry, I made a mistake. They're on the right side of the TV.\n#Person1#: Thanks.\n#Person2#: Oh, and here are your glasses. They were next to your cell phone.
#Person1#: I need help picking out a lotion.\n#Person2#: It would be my pleasure to help you. What do you need help with?\n#Person1#: I picked up some poison oak while hiking, and I can't stop itching.\n#Person2#: We have Techne, and it is available in lotion or cream.\n#Person1#: Do you find that one works better than the other?\n#Person2#: I have heard that the cream is longer lasting.\n#Person1#: Is there anything I can take that will help with the itching?\n#Person2#: If you take an antihistamine, that would help a lot.\n#Person1#: Thank you for helping me figure out what to do with my poison oak.\n#Person2#: It was a pleasure. Come back anytime.
#Person1#: I put in two quarters for a coke, but nothing came out of the machine.\n#Person2#: Really? Let me check it.\n#Person1#: I'm sure it's broken.\n#Person2#: No, ma'am. I'm afraid you put in only one quarter and one dime.
#Person1#: What would my new duties be?\n#Person2#: Your main responsibility is trouble-shooting between top management and the general employees.\n#Person1#: Will I have the chance to take business trip abroad once in a while?\n#Person2#: Yes, you definitely will.
#Person1#: How is the college search going?\n#Person2#: It's a huge headache. I have no idea what I want to do.\n#Person1#: But don't you want to study music? Shouldn't it be easy?\n#Person2#: It should be, but there are too many options. My grades are good enough that I have a lot of choices, but after that. . .\n#Person1#: I know. You have to decide if you want to attend a school in a city or in the country, a big school or a small school, a public or private school. . .\n#Person2#: Yup, you understand. And my parents are trying to pressure me into going to a Catholic college. They both attended one and think that it combines a good education with good discipline. And the tuition 3 is usually pretty low.\n#Person1#: I see. Well, don't forget to talk to the college counselor at the school. He usually gives good advice and can help point you in the right direction. He gave me some information, and next week I'm going to take a look at some of the colleges he recommended.\n#Person2#: Thanks for the information. And good luck in your college search.
#Person1#: Hello, Peace Hotel.\n#Person2#: Hello, I'm calling from Beijing. I'd like to reserve a double room with a bath from tonight on for five days, please.\n#Person1#: A moment, please. I'll check our room availability for these days. . . Yes, that's all right. What's your name please?\n#Person2#: John Smith. J-O-H-N S-M-I-T-H.
#Person1#: Good morning, may I help you?\n#Person2#: Good morning. I want to remit 1, 000 yuan to my sister in Shanghai.\n#Person1#: Please fill out this form.\n#Person2#: OK. . . Do I need to put on my sister's name for the receiver?\n#Person1#: Yes. You must put on her name and address.\n#Person2#: OK, I see. Here you are. Is that OK now?\n#Person1#: Let me check. Yes. Your 1, 000 remittance, please.\n#Person2#: Here you are. What is the rate?\n#Person1#: This rate is one percent. That will be 10 yuan.\n#Person2#: OK. When will this remittance arrive?\n#Person1#: Generally it will arrive within three days.\n#Person2#: That's good.
#Person1#: Excuse me, can you tell me where central Park Street is?\n#Person2#: Turn right at the third light and then go straight for two blocks.\n#Person1#: Is it far?\n#Person2#: No. It's only a ten-minute walk.\n#Person1#: I see. Thanks a lot.\n#Person2#: You're welcome.
#Person1#: Well, I'm not sure. It sounds as if the movie is rather violent for us.\n#Person2#: Yes, but it's very famous. The director won some kind of award. Peter saw it a few months ago, and according to him, some of it was violent, but it was all done in a very 'matter-of-fact' way. Nothing to... eh... you know...\n#Person1#: OK, then. I suppose it will make a change from comedies.
#Person1#: How are your French lessons going?\n#Person2#: Well, I'm no longer taking French lessons.\n#Person1#: Are you kidding? You told me you made up your mind to study French well this summer. Didn't you sign up for the four-week course?\n#Person2#: I did. But the teacher told me not to come back any more after only one week and he returned my money for the remaining three weeks.\n#Person1#: How come? I've never heard of a case like that before. Did you have a quarrel with your teacher?\n#Person2#: Of course not. At first everything went well and he was satisfied with me. But he got angry after I broke the class rules several times.\n#Person1#: It was your fault, I think. You'd gone too far.\n#Person2#: Perhaps. But I don't understand why he told me to stop coming. He was very kind, you know.\n#Person1#: Just forget it.
#Person1#: You must be Kelly. Thanks for coming. It's hard to find a good babysitter on a Friday night.\n#Person2#: I like watching kids, and I need the extra money. I'd like to talk to you about my new rate increases.
#Person1#: Hello? I would like to speak to Mr. Lee.\n#Person2#: This is Lee speaking.\n#Person1#: This is Linda, your old friend.\n#Person2#: Oh, how are you, Linda? I'm glad you called.\n#Person1#: Mr. Smith wrote to me that you were coming to our city. May I see you at your hotel right away?\n#Person2#: Please hold on a moment. I have to check my schedule. Yes, that's ail fight.\n#Person1#: Great. I'll be there in haft an hour.\n#Person2#: All right, I'll be expecting you.\n#Person1#: Oh, I almost forgot. What's your room number?\n#Person2#: It's the No. 311 on the second floor. Please call me if you can't find me.\n#Person1#: I'll do that. See you later.
#Person1#: Hi, Tim. So, are you doing some last-minute shopping before the weekend?\n#Person2#: Well, actually, I'm looking for supplies to put together 72-hour kits for each member of my family.\n#Person1#: [A] 72-hour kit? What's that?\n#Person2#: Basically, a 72-hour kit contains emergency supplies you would need to sustain yourself for three days in case of an emergency, like an earthquake.\n#Person1#: An earthquake?! We haven't had an earthquake in years.\n#Person2#: Well, you never know; you have to be prepared. Hey, if earthquakes don't get you, it could be a flood, hurricane, snowstorm, power outage, fire, alien attack. [Alien attack!] Well, you never know. Think of any situation in which you might find yourself without the basic necessities of life, including shelter, food, and water, for over a period of time.\n#Person1#: Hum. So, what do you keep in a 42-hour, um, ... I mean 72-kit?\n#Person2#: Well, you should have enough food and water to last you three days, and you might want to pack a basic water filter or water purification tablets in case your only water source turns out to be a murky pool of bug-infested water. [Ugh!] Hey, sometimes you don't have a choice, and as for food, you should keep it simple: food that requires no preparation and that doesn't spoil. And no canned goods because they are often too heavy and bulky. [Okay, that makes sense.] And unless you have a can opener or the can has a pull-tab lid, you'll have to use a rock or something to open them. [Ah, instant mashed green beens.] Yeah, and oh, energy bars, beef jerky, and a mix of nuts, raisins, and chocolate are possibilities.\n#Person1#: Huh, the food might be nasty, but I guess you could survive ... barely.\n#Person2#: Well, the food doesn't have to taste bad; just select things that are easy to prepare, and you might want to include some basic comfort foods like a couple of candy bars. Then, you have to decide on the type of shelter you might need.\n#Person1#: A hotel sounds nice.\n#Person2#: Yeah, but that's really not an option. The reality is that you might have to evacuate to a shelter, possibly with hundreds or thousands of other people.\n#Person1#: That doesn't sound very fun ... everyone packed together like sardines in a can. Unsanitary conditions. Disease.\n#Person2#: Ah, now you're sounding paranoid, but if a shelter isn't available, you might be completely on your own, so I always pack an emergency sleeping bag or small, lightweight tent in the event that I have to survive on the street or in a park.\n#Person1#: Wow.\n#Person2#: And among other things, you should pack a flashlight, portable radio, extra batteries, a small first-aid kit, personal items like a toothbrush or toothpaste ... Having a change of clothing is also important.\n#Person1#: What about money? I have a credit card.\n#Person2#: Right. Like that's going to help when the power is out. You'd better be prepared with coins and cash, and having small bills is a must.\n#Person1#: So, what do you do to communicate with other family members in case you get separated?\n#Person2#: Oh, in that case? I always pack two-way radios to communicate with the group. You can never depend on cell phones. [Okay.] Plus, you should decide on a meeting point in case your family gets separated.\n#Person1#: Well, that sounds like a detailed plan, definitely.\n#Person2#: Oh, that's not all. You never know what weather conditions you might encounter, so packing a rain poncho, a jacket, and something to start a fire with could be very useful.\n#Person1#: Like Matches?\n#Person2#: Matches? If You drop those in a puddle of water, you're toast. You need to pack at least three forms of fire starter: a magnifying glass, a high-quality lighter, and waterproof matches.\n#Person1#: Wow. I never thought about those either. So, what do you do if you have small kids? They'd probably go stir-crazy under such conditions.\n#Person2#: You're exactly right, so a little extra preparation for them is needed. If you have to evacuate to a shelter to wait out a disaster, kids soon will be bored out of their minds, so you have to pack small card games, paper, or something like pencils or crayons to draw with.\n#Person1#: You know, preparing a 72-hour kit makes perfect sense ...\n#Person2#: Yeah, but most people thinking about it after it is too late.
#Person1#: There are something wrong with my computer. \n#Person2#: Really, what's wrong with it ? \n#Person1#: The computer doesn't work when I push the power botton. \n#Person2#: Oh, do you use your computer often ? \n#Person1#: Yes , I don't know why it doesn't work this time. \n#Person2#: Don't worry. Have you got receipt with you ? \n#Person1#: Yeah! \n#Person2#: We'll go to your house and repair it on Tuesday. Ok? \n#Person1#: OK, I'll expected you around 2 o'clock ? \n#Person2#: See you then. 
#Person1#: Do you have any seats available? \n#Person2#: Yes. This way please. \n#Person1#: What's the special today? \n#Person2#: I recommend our New English Pizza. \n#Person1#: Then give me a large one and an egg drop soup. \n#Person2#: Okay. Wait a minute please. 
#Person1#: Good afternoon, sir. May I help you? \n#Person2#: Yes, I'd like a cheeseburger and a large order of French fries. \n#Person1#: Would you like anything to drink with that? \n#Person2#: Yes, a medium Coke. \n#Person1#: Will that be all? \n#Person2#: Yes. \n#Person1#: For here or to go? \n#Person2#: To go, please. ( The attendant hands the customer his order. ) \n#Person1#: That'll be $ 4. 25. . . ( The customer gives her a 5 dollar bill. ) . . . out of five. Here is your change, sir. Have a nice day. 
#Person1#: OK, Ann, you spent quite a bit of time in Australia recently so why don't you talk about that? \n#Person2#: I really liked living in Australia. I was an international student and I studied education at the university of Sydney. And living in Sydney was fantasticbecuase I could go to the beach anytime I wanted and there was a great nightlife in Sydney. There are lots of great clubs. And people were very, very friendly and easy-going and I met a lot of international people in living Sydney. \n#Person1#: Mm-hm. How long were you there? \n#Person2#: I was there for almost a year. \n#Person1#: Oh, OK. \n#Person2#: And I travelled a little bit in Australia. I went up the east coast. Up to Frasier Island. Which is a world heritage site. And I saw dingos running along the beach and sharks in the water. We climbed cliffs and went through a rain forest and went camping and then we went up to the. . . , which is a but north. And the further north you go in Australia, the hotter it gets. So we were able to go swimming in the ocean and I went diving for the first time but it was a little bit risky cause I didn't have a diving license, so I went on an introductory dive and I saw a giant clam that had a really purple spongy inside that I was able to touch and then the clam closed up really quickly. \n#Person1#: So, did you, did you lose your finger? \n#Person2#: Almost. \n#Person1#: Almost. Ah, you're lucky. Um, it's funny, you go in the water and you worry about sharks, but not clams. \n#Person2#: Exactly. \n#Person1#: Will you be going back to Australia soon? \n#Person2#: I'd like to go and live there for at least another year. Probably I'll go back to Sydney or maybe I'll go down to Melbourne because it's a really interesting cultural city. They have lot of museums and parks. 
#Person1#: I remember you said that you like China because it has cheap beers. \n#Person2#: Yes, unbelievably cheap. Carlsberg is less than $1. \n#Person1#: Why do you drink? I mean, where does drinking get you? \n#Person2#: It's fashionable. \n#Person1#: Come on, you don't even know that blinds following is a sign of immaturity. \n#Person2#: Mary, it's not about the blind following. What matter is I enjoy in drinking. It's like when you get off of work. You're so tired. You need to get relaxed. You can't just turn on the TV and keep watch the programs until you fall asleep. You need to make your after work time more fun. \n#Person1#: How? By drinking? \n#Person2#: Drinking is just part of it. I mean, you have a bunch of friends coming by and having fun. You drink and talk. And the more you drink, the more you talk. It makes me so relaxed. \n#Person1#: When did you begin to drink? \n#Person2#: It's a long time ago. When I first went to a bar to pick up girls there, I saw the most beautiful girl sitting and sipping a coke. Then I went up to her and said' can I buy you a drink? ' \n#Person1#: And then? \n#Person2#: Then I talked to her and got her number. You know what? When you don't know what to say? Just drink. \n#Person1#: So you get drunk every day? 
#Person1#: Hi, Rosie. How was your New York visit?\n#Person2#: Fantastic. I love the weather in New York. Summers are mostly cool, but it is very hot here in New Delhi.\n#Person1#: It will probably rain tomorrow.\n#Person2#: I hope so. My uncle lives in London. It has a beautiful climate.\n#Person1#: Yes, London is a wonderful city.\n#Person2#: By the way, should we go shopping today?\n#Person1#: It's sunny outside. I won't be able to go. We can go in the evening if the weather is nice.
#Person1#: Anything interesting in the paper today, dear?\n#Person2#: Well, yeah! There are a few here that might interest us. Here's one for just $400. It only has one bedroom but it sounds nice, near Lake Street.\n#Person1#: Yeah. Let me see what the cheapest two-bedroom apartment is. Oh, here's one on Market Street. It's a real bargain, only $350. But it doesn't have any furniture.\n#Person2#: Well, it costs a lot to buy all the furniture.\n#Person1#: Oh, here's another one for just over $400. This sounds very interesting. It's on South Street, that's a nice area!\n#Person2#: Yes, it's quiet. Did you say 2 bedrooms?\n#Person1#: Yes, at 415 dollars.\n#Person2#: Why don't we go and have a look?\n#Person1#: OK, I'll give them a call.
#Person1#: Who wrote this? It's completely wrong.\n#Person2#: What do you mean?\n#Person1#: Just look at it. The accident wasn't on Thursday. It was on Tuesday. The accident happened at lunch time. Really you should remember the fact. It was a girl not a boy lying on the road and she hadn't tripped over anything. She had just slipped because the road was wet from the rain.\n#Person2#: OK. Everything about the truck and car is right.\n#Person1#: I don't believe you. Why do you think there was a truck?\n#Person2#: Well, the article says so.\n#Person1#: Don't believe everything you read. It was a mini bus and the mini bus driver was fine. The person who flew out was a passenger at the front of the minibus.\n#Person2#: So it should be bad news for a passenger on the minibus and I guess the information about the car is correct.\n#Person1#: It is, but I think that is personal information and we shouldn't printed in the newspaper so cancel the entire paragraph.\n#Person2#: OK.
#Person1#: When I think of giving a good gift, I think about my uncle.\n#Person2#: Why is that? I know he gave you a snow globe yesterday. Doesn't that seem like a strange gift?\n#Person1#: Well, I'll be honest, his gifts can be out of times, but they just make me laugh.\n#Person2#: I'm glad. But my family always give very practical gifts.\n#Person1#: Oh, like what?\n#Person2#: We give gift cards of our favorite stores or even just money.\n#Person1#: Emm, I guess those are useful. But they don't seem like very fun gifts to receive.\n#Person2#: That's ridiculous. Gift cards and cash are always fun to receive.\n#Person1#: Gift cards and cash are practical. But they're not very imaginative.\n#Person2#: So, I can use them to buy anything I want. I like that.\n#Person1#: But giving a gift like that is taking the easy way out. You're not taking the time to select a gift you know the person will enjoy.\n#Person2#: OK, but what if the giver is wrong? What if you don't like the gift?\n#Person1#: In that case, I'll just ask for the receipt and return it. Or I regift it.\n#Person2#: Ah, how awkward.\n#Person1#: Well, people understand. And I'm always grateful for any gift.\n#Person2#: Really? If someone buys you something random, then they probably won't really thinking of you.\n#Person1#: That's true. A good gift should be thoughtful.\n#Person2#: So what makes a snow globe from your uncle so special?\n#Person1#: Winter is our favorite season. We both love snow.\n#Person2#: How nice. I see your point now. But for my birthday, please don't try to guess what I might like. A simple gift card is fine.\n#Person1#: OK, dear.
#Person1#: Hello, can I get a taxi? We're just outside the city limits.\n#Person2#: No problem, ma'am. Where exactly are you going? There is an extra charge for anything over 20 kilometers.\n#Person1#: The Roxy Club downtown. There are 6 of us though. Do you have any bigger car so we don't need to take two taxis?\n#Person2#: Yes, on the weekends we do. However, it's $3 more to have the bigger car sent your way.\n#Person1#: That will be fine. And we should be well under the 20 kilometers to our destination.\n#Person2#: Yes, I can see that. Would you like us to send that for you now?\n#Person1#: Yes, please.
#Person1#: Hi, Maria, how's it going?\n#Person2#: Good. I finished all my courses today, so I can relax.\n#Person1#: Great. Maybe you'll have time for some traveling now.\n#Person2#: Maybe, but I think I'll stay at home this weekend.\n#Person1#: Oh, well, why don't you come to my house? My family is coming over. We're having a barbeque in the back garden.\n#Person2#: Thanks. But it's with your families, so you probably don't want other people there.\n#Person1#: No, really. Don't worry, because I'm inviting a few people from my class as well. I'd really like you to come.\n#Person2#: That would be great. Is it a special family gathering?\n#Person1#: Well, my oldest sister has a new baby girl. So it's a bit of a celebration for that.\n#Person2#: Oh, you say Daisy has a baby? She married 2 years ago, didn't she?\n#Person1#: Yes.
#Person1#: Hamilton High School, can I help you?\n#Person2#: Yes, I have some questions to ask. My son hopes to study in your school.\n#Person1#: Welcome. I am glad to help you.\n#Person2#: Thanks. We just knew about the school yesterday. What if I miss the application deadline?\n#Person1#: You can still apply as a 'late'. Your application will be given a number. We will take students in number order.\n#Person2#: Does my child get transportation?\n#Person1#: If you live more than 3 miles, 3 miles included, away from our school, your son can qualify for transportation.\n#Person2#: How can I reach my son's teacher?\n#Person1#: You can leave a message in the office at 310-280-1501. You can also send them an email. All emails are listed on our website.\n#Person2#: What if the teacher doesn't get back to me?\n#Person1#: If there is no response, please call the director at 310-280-1452.\n#Person2#: My child is into music. Can he continue to develop his interest?\n#Person1#: Sure.
#Person1#: Hi, Michael. It's Sylvie, in Brussels. Are you getting ready for the conference next month? How are you going to San Francisco? Are you flying direct from Dublin?\n#Person2#: Um...well, probably have to change in, either in London or in Amsterdam? What about you?\n#Person1#: Well, I still need to book my flight from Amsterdam. So shall we catch the same flight?\n#Person2#: Yeah, that makes sense. So I need to book a flight to Amsterdam then.Shall I look into flights to San Francisco as well?\n#Person1#: Hum...Yeah, if that's OK.\n#Person2#: Yeah, no problem. I'll look on the Internet before lunch. What about booking a hotel?\n#Person1#: Well, shall I contact the San Francisco office to see if they know any good places? I can get in touch with Rita.\n#Person2#: Yeah, good idea.\n#Person1#: I'll give her a call this afternoon.\n#Person2#: Excellent.
#Person1#: I ' Ve been told you might have a vacant room.\n#Person2#: Yes. I have a spare room.\n#Person1#: How much are you asking?\n#Person2#: 10.00 dollars a night.\n#Person1#: Could I see the room, please?\n#Person2#: Sure.Come on in.
#Person1#: Hello, how can I be of service?\n#Person2#: Hello. I'm not sure who I need to speak to. I got this 50 yuan note today and it seems a little odd to me.\n#Person1#: The first thing we do is check the feel of the paper ;d oes it feel too thick or too thin? Then we check the watermark. In my opinion it is counterfeit. I'll just run it through the scanner to double check.\n#Person2#: What happens now?\n#Person1#: Well, it's our policy to confiscate all counterfeit notes. So, unfortunately you'll lose this 50 RIB. We'll give you a receipt to show the note has been confiscated.
#Person1#: What sort of shopping is nearby, Mr. Taylor?\n#Person2#: Call me John. This is a great area of the city for shopping. There ' s a grocery store just around the corner.\n#Person1#: What about things other than food?\n#Person2#: Well, the Riverside Mall has 200 stores in it, including four major department stores.\n#Person1#: Are there small shops near here as well?\n#Person2#: Yes, on 4th street, near the movie theater there are many specialty shops, including clothing boutiques.\n#Person1#: Well, that sounds just wonderful.\n#Person2#: Yes, it ' s a really nice neighborhood.
#Person1#: Thank you for purchasing your new mattress with us.\n#Person2#: No, thank you.\n#Person1#: Would you like us to deliver the mattress for you, sir?\n#Person2#: That would be great.\n#Person1#: When do you want it delivered?\n#Person2#: I need it delivered tomorrow. Will that be possible?\n#Person1#: What time exactly?\n#Person2#: I need it delivered at 12 o'clock.\n#Person1#: We can have it to you at that time.\n#Person2#: That's not a problem?\n#Person1#: We will deliver your mattress tomorrow at 12 o'clock.\n#Person2#: That's great! Thank you very much.
#Person1#: have you seen the new Cosmo magazine that I was reading this morning?\n#Person2#: I think I may have seen it on the kitchen table.\n#Person1#: you're right, thanks. There's an interesting interview with a top director about his latest film that I want to finish.\n#Person2#: who's the director?\n#Person1#: it's Martin Scorsese. You liked his film, The Departed, didn't you?\n#Person2#: yes, it was fantastic! Can I read the article when you're finished?\n#Person1#: sure. You know it has an online edition, too. You should go online to read if you want to read it now.\n#Person2#: that's ok. I'll wait until you're finished. Just out of curiosity, do you have a subscription for that magadize?\n#Person1#: no. I don't buy it regularly enough for it to be worthwhile.\n#Person2#: how much does the magadize cost?\n#Person1#: it's almost three pounds now, and I think they're going to put the price up to four pounds soon.\n#Person2#: that's quite expensive. Who is their target audience?\n#Person1#: Cosmo mainly has a middle-class readership, but I think circulation will fall dramatically if the price goes up anymore.\n#Person2#: I bet you'll still buy it, though. You wouldn't be able to live without your fashion magazine!
#Person1#: We have another traditional holiday-the Dragon Boat Festival.\n#Person2#: When is it?\n#Person1#: It falls on the fifth day of the fifth lunar month.\n#Person2#: Could you tell me the origin of the two festivals?\n#Person1#: OK. The Dragon Boat Festival is a way to commemorate a great ancient poet named Quyuan. On that day, people will hold a boat race as a symbol of the attempt to save him who threw himself into the river.\n#Person2#: Why do people eat rice cakes on that day?\n#Person1#: In order to prevent the fish from eating the poet's body.\n#Person2#: It sounds so moving.
#Person1#: Did you smell something? It smells so great.\n#Person2#: It must come from the bakery on the corner. They are baking cookies. Their cookies are very popular in town.\n#Person1#: How come I never knew that? Do they have a new baker or something?\n#Person2#: I think so. The bakery invited a famous baker from the USA. He is good at making cookies.\n#Person1#: Let's go and get some cookies. I am hungry now.\n#Person2#: Look at the swiss roll over there, they look delicious, too, I am thinking about buying one.\n#Person1#: You can taste some before you buy it. They have food tasting at the counter.\n#Person2#: I am starting loving this bakery now.\n#Person1#: It's one of my favorite bakeries.\n#Person2#: You should have told me earlier. I am a cookie lover.
#Person1#: Great. The bed is exactly what I have been looking for!\n#Person2#: You have good taste. It's made of red wood.\n#Person1#: Oh, I like red wood. How much do you charge for it?\n#Person2#: 300 dollars.\n#Person1#: That's sheer robbery!\n#Person2#: Believe me, it's worth the price.\n#Person1#: It's more than I can afford. Can I make an offer?\n#Person2#: How much are you willing to pay?\n#Person1#: Shall we make it 250 dollars?\n#Person2#: No. That price would hardly cover the cost.\n#Person1#: What about 260 dollars?\n#Person2#: 275 dollars is the lowest price I can offer.\n#Person1#: It's a deal.
#Person1#: Fill it up, PLS.\n#Person2#: Premium or regular, Madam?\n#Person1#: Premium, PLS. Could you check my tyres, too? I think they need air.\n#Person2#: No problem, Madam. Should I check the air in the spare tyre as well?\n#Person1#: I don't think so. It's brand-new.\n#Person2#: Should I clean the windshield for you?\n#Person1#: Yes, PLS. I also need you to check the oil and the radiator.\n#Person2#: All right, Madam. It's ok. There is hardly any water in the radiator. It's dangerous, Madam. You could break down, because of the heat you know.\n#Person1#: Pls fill it up with water then.\n#Person2#: Anything you say, Madam.\n#Person1#: Do you take credit card?\n#Person2#: No, we don't. I am sorry. It's 30 dollars and 10 cents in total.\n#Person1#: 30 dollars and 10 cents? Here you go.\n#Person2#: Thank you, Madam. Have a nice drive!
#Person1#: We are interested in placing a large order for your wool carpet.\n#Person2#: How much would you like?\n#Person1#: 10, 000 sq. m. You should give us a discount for such a large quantity.\n#Person2#: A higher discount will be given for a big order, so we are willing to give you a 5 % discount this time.\n#Person1#: The Iranians will give us a 10 % discount if such a high order is placed with them. No doubt you know an incentive discount encourages the buyers and helps expand seller's business.\n#Person2#: Of course I know. But there is too high a rate. Frankly speaking, the maximum discount we can make is 6 %.
#Person1#: When in Rome, do as the Romans do, they say.\n#Person2#: What do the Romans do?\n#Person1#: They live in Rome, of course, and go to work by car or bus. But sometimes it takes too long that way because of the traffic jams, so they walk.\n#Person2#: In other words, the Romans do what everyone else does.\n#Person1#: Yes, but they do it differently. Everything is different.\n#Person2#: What do you mean?\n#Person1#: Well, the climate's different for a start. It doesn't rain so much as it does in England. The sun shines more often.\n#Person2#: I envy them the sun.\n#Person1#: I know. You hate the rain, don't you?\n#Person2#: I certainly do.\n#Person1#: And a Roman really Ioves life. Eye knows how to enjoy himself.\n#Person2#: They always eat spaghetti and drink wine, don't they?\n#Person1#: Not always. But they like a good meal. Lots of tourists go to Rome just for the food, you know.\n#Person2#: Really? How much does it cost to fly to Rome?\n#Person1#: I don't know exactly, but it costs a lot of money.
#Person1#: Do you have a question, Mary?\n#Person2#: No. That's not why I raised my hand. I need to go to the ladies'room.\n#Person1#: Let me give you a hall pass for it.\n#Person2#: What's a hall pass?\n#Person1#: With a hall pass, you can go to the ladies'room or wherever you need to go during class time.\n#Person2#: I see.\n#Person1#: If a teacher stops you in the hallway, just show him or her the pass.\n#Person2#: Or else I'll get into trouble.\n#Person1#: That's right.
#Person1#: Good morning miss. Wang\n#Person2#: Good morning Mr. Li\n#Person1#: It's a beautiful morning isn't it?\n#Person2#: Oh. It's a nice day indeed\n#Person1#: I hope it won't be too hot, I can't stand the heat\n#Person2#: Really. For me too.
#Person1#: so, how should we go to the theatre?\n#Person2#: let's take the bus.\n#Person1#: I hate the bus system in London! The bus drivers are rude, the buses are never on time, and there are few people around who can help you.\n#Person2#: it's not that bad. You probably just had a bad experience once.\n#Person1#: it wasn't just once. Every single time I take the bus, something bad happens to me or to someone else on the bus.\n#Person2#: we could take the subway, but we'd have to go three stops along one line and then change trains twice.\n#Person1#: train fares are twice as expensive as the bus fare, too.\n#Person2#: if we don't hurry up, we'll miss the show. Should we take the bus?\n#Person1#: we're already late, so I think we had better take a taxi.\n#Person2#: I don't think we'll be able to find a taxi very easily during hush hours. Let's just take the bus.\n#Person1#: fine. Have a look at the timetable to find out when the next one arrives.\n#Person2#: it looks like it should be here in just a few minutes.\n#Person1#: don't worry. Nothing bad will happen. I'll even buy your ticket for you.\n#Person2#: thanks, that was nice of you.\n#Person1#: see, now something good has happened to you on a bus trip!
#Person1#: You look really wiped out?\n#Person2#: I had meetings back to back all morning. And phone rang off the hook from the minute I walked into the office.\n#Person1#: Not a good day. I hate to tell you that Mr. Thomas wants to see the profit's statement for new project tomorrow morning.\n#Person2#: I can't believe it. I guess I'll be here until 10 again tonight.
#Person1#: Hi, Lucy, you are very popular with people around you, what are your tricks?\n#Person2#: Thank you for saying so. I don't know, probably because I like sharing my experience and knowledge with them. I think this kind of communication helps to improve our work efficiency and also helps to get along with colleagues.\n#Person1#: Sharing knowledge can be very settled and some second stances. People may think you are telling them how to do their work. If they take it personally, they feel angry at you and even become reluctant to support you at work.\n#Person2#: That is true. Some people will misunderstand your intention and lets you do it in the long threatening way. For example, it is not sensible at all to arguing with the others or correcting someone in front of other people. To show your friendliness and willingness to share is much more important than to show off.\n#Person1#: You are quite right. Thank you for sharing your experience with me. I learned a lot.\n#Person2#: You're welcome.
#Person1#: Mike, these flowers are just gorgeous.\n#Person2#: I'm glad you like them. Happy birthday!\n#Person1#: I can't thank you enough. I'm really touched. I don't know what to say.\n#Person2#: Forget it. It's my pleasure. You mean a lot to me.\n#Person1#: You're the best!
#Person1#: Hello, Dana Okro.\n#Person2#: Hello, Dana, this is Kevin Abrahams from Eureka Corp. I don't know if you'll remember me but we met last week at the Chamber of Commerce luncheon.\n#Person1#: Oh, yes. Hi, how are you?\n#Person2#: Great. Do you have a few minutes right now for me to tell you a little bit more about the data management tools our company has to offer? It won't take long.\n#Person1#: Actually, I'm really swamped right now and I'll be going into a meeting in a few minutes. Is there any literature you can send me?\n#Person2#: Oh, sure, I understand. I'd be happy to send you a promotional packet about the programs that I think might best suit a company of your size. Would it be okay if I called again to see if you have any questions?\n#Person1#: Let's do this. Since I'm not sure when I'll get a chance to read the material, why don't I give you a call if I have any questions. Now, I'm really sorry, but I have to get going to this meeting.\n#Person2#: No problem at all. I won't keep you any longer. I'll put a package to you in the mail and we'll go from there.\n#Person1#: Sounds good.\n#Person2#: Thanks for your time.\n#Person1#: No problem. Bye, bye.
#Person1#: What do you think of your personality?\n#Person2#: I am quite alive and energetic. I am a curious person, and I like to learn new things.\n#Person1#: Do you think you are introverted or extroverted?\n#Person2#: I am quite outgoing, I think.\n#Person1#: How do you get along with people whose characters are different from your own?\n#Person2#: I try to adapt myself.
#Person1#: Lucy, I'd like to fix the light in the corridor, it keeps flashing, which drives me crazy. Would you like to help me with the ladder?\n#Person2#: Monica, wait a moment. I think we'd better call the repair man to do it.\n#Person1#: I think I can handle it by myself.\n#Person2#: I'd like you to have a look at the safety manual of our company.\n#Person1#: I see. If I got hurt when fixing the light, even during office hours, I wouldn't get compensation from our company since repairing is not my responsibility.\n#Person2#: Other company rules also need your attention.\n#Person1#: Like this one?\n#Person2#: Never wear loose clothes or hair when operating the shredder.\n#Person1#: Yeah, thank you for telling me.\n#Person2#: Don't mention it.
#Person1#: Good morning, sir. Is there anything I can do for you?\n#Person2#: Yes, I would like to have a suit made to measure.\n#Person1#: Sure. How do you like your suit?\n#Person2#: I want a single breasted suit. Here is the cloth.
#Person1#: Hi, I am so glad to see you.\n#Person2#: Are you kidding me? Why do you say so?\n#Person1#: You know, I'm about to graduate and I have to look for a job as soon as possible. But I haven't the faintest idea of how to go about finding a job.\n#Person2#: OK. Let me see where to start.\n#Person1#: I guess first I should prepare a resume, right?\n#Person2#: Sure. You should include your name, address and phone number in your resume.\n#Person1#: Then what else should I put into my resume?\n#Person2#: Your job objectives, of course. In other words, what kind of job are you searching for?\n#Person1#: I got it. Then I should mention my educating background and working experience, should I?\n#Person2#: Yes. And don't forget to list them by date. Besides, you should begin with the most recent and then move backward.\n#Person1#: I see. Is that all there is to it?\n#Person2#: No, it's also necessary to list a few related interests that are in some way connected to the jobs you want to take.\n#Person1#: Oh, good point. You mean here I should show off my special skills and talents to impress the boss.\n#Person2#: You said it. At last you'd better attach a list of references to your resume.\n#Person1#: That's easy.\n#Person2#: And one more thing, smile widely.
#Person1#: Good afternoon, sir. Can I help you?\n#Person2#: Good afternoon, I want to pick up a new shaver since the old one has retired.\n#Person1#: Which brand are you interested in?\n#Person2#: I'm still not sure. The type with top quality, I guess. Well, which one do you recommend?\n#Person1#: Do you prefer imported ones or domestic ones?\n#Person2#: It doesn't matter much. If it has high quality and reasonable price, it will be OK.\n#Person1#: How about Flymo? It's selling well.\n#Person2#: Do you have a warranty on it?\n#Person1#: Of course. The warranty period is one year.\n#Person2#: If there's something wrong with it in a week, can I come back to change it?\n#Person1#: Sure. But you must show us the receipt. If something comes up, we'll change it for you.\n#Person2#: OK. I'll take one.
#Person1#: Can I collect unemployment benefits?\n#Person2#: Are you still working?\n#Person1#: My employer cut back on my hours.\n#Person2#: If you got laid off or are working a lot fewer hours, you may qualify.\n#Person1#: Do I definitely get to collect unemployment?\n#Person2#: Not all jobs pay into unemployment insurance, so their employees cannot collect benefits.\n#Person1#: How do I check out my status to collect unemployment?\n#Person2#: You should have noticed unemployment insurance being deducted from your paycheck. Check your pay stubs.\n#Person1#: How much will my unemployment check be?\n#Person2#: The more money you made, the more you will earn on unemployment. They have a formula.
#Person1#: Is there anything I can do for you?\n#Person2#: Yes. I am looking for a pair of gloves.\n#Person1#: What about this one? It's the latest.\n#Person2#: Excuse me, but I want a pair of mittens.\n#Person1#: I am sorry, it's out of stock right now.
#Person1#: Can I help you, sir?\n#Person2#: I want to have a haircut.\n#Person1#: Please take a seat. Do you need a shampoo?\n#Person2#: How much is a regular haircut without shampoo?\n#Person1#: $ 10.\n#Person2#: And how much for haircut with shampoo?\n#Person1#: The total charge is $ 15.\n#Person2#: Since it is, I need a haircut with shampoo.\n#Person1#: Well, what shampoo do you prefer?\n#Person2#: SEEK, please.\n#Person1#: ( 5 minutes later ) What sort of hairstyles do you like?\n#Person2#: What hairstyle do you feel will look best on me?\n#Person1#: I think a crew cut is the most suitable for you.\n#Person2#: I have the same idea as you.
#Person1#: Taxi!\n#Person2#: Where to?\n#Person1#: Beijing International Airport. Would you please help me with my baggage?\n#Person2#: Certainly. Let's put the suitcase in the boot.\n#Person1#: Thank you. I've got just 50 minutes to go. Can we manage?\n#Person2#: Take it easy. We should be able to make it unless we get caught in a traffic jam.\n#Person1#: I can't afford to miss my 9:40 flight.\n#Person2#: Don't worry. The traffic is smooth. You will be there in time for your flight.
#Person1#: pardon me. Could you please pass me the tissue?\n#Person2#: sure, here you are.\n#Person1#: thanks, I didn't expect the dish to be so spicy. Are you ok?\n#Person2#: yeah, I think the food is alright, it's not too spicy though it's a little salty for me. But you are Chinese, you should have known better.\n#Person1#: well, not every Chinese can handle spicy food in the way people from Sichuan and Cuizhou provinces can. Back where I come from, people don't eat a lot of papers and chilies.\n#Person2#: Oh, I see how this food can be really hard for you. I can sympathize with that. I stayed in Sichuan for a year. The food was difficult at the beginning. Every dish was so spicy. After a while, I got u\n#Person1#: yeah, you can increase you tolerance for spicy food, but so far, I haven't had the need or the opportunity. Every time I try spicy food, it is a total disaster for my nose and eyes.\n#Person2#: I completely understand. I didn't intend on liking spicy food at first either, but when you have no other choicest, you've got to adapt.\n#Person1#: yeah, I guess that's a typical example of when in Rome, do as the Romans do.\n#Person2#: exactly.
#Person1#: Professor Wang, what is non-tariff barrier?\n#Person2#: Non-tariff barrier is another mean to restrict imports.\n#Person1#: Can you give an example?\n#Person2#: For example, some countries restrict imports by quantitative restriction.\n#Person1#: Why?\n#Person2#: This is used to protect local industries or to achieve certain political objectives.\n#Person1#: Oh, Are there other means?\n#Person2#: Technical barriers are set for imported goods.\n#Person1#: This is designed to exclude them from domestic market, isn't it?\n#Person2#: Yes, some countries may use some of the unnecessary health rules to exclude foreign food.
#Person1#: Look at my new car!\n#Person2#: That's not a car. It's a toy, and you're still taking the bus to school.\n#Person1#: Well, it's a model of the car I'm going to buy when I get my first job. It helps me want to work harder.
#Person1#: Hey, Sis. Are you interested in buying some used books for school? You can really save some money that way.\n#Person2#: Well, what do you have?\n#Person1#: Well, let's see. I have a science book called, Today's World, and I'm selling it for thirty dollars.\n#Person2#: Thirty? That's a little expensive for a beat-up book like that.\n#Person1#: Maybe so, but I bought it for sixty. Plus, I wrote a lot of notes in the book that should help you with the class ... if you could read my writing.\n#Person2#: What else are you selling?\n#Person1#: Okay, I have English writing textbook for fourteen dollars, a math book for twenty-three, and a novel for only seven bucks.\n#Person2#: Uh, Hmmm.\n#Person1#: It's up to you. You know, these things go fast. I mean you have to listen to my advice as your older brother.\n#Person2#: Psh. I'll take the English book and the novel. I need both of those for sure. I think I'll hold off on buying other books for now. [Okay.] Teachers are always changing their minds about textbooks. [Alright.] And, what are those books?\n#Person1#: Which ones? Ah, ah, nothing. Never mind.\n#Person2#: Wait, wait, wait. Finding Your Perfect Someone. You're selling it for forty dollars? What's, what's this all about? And the price?\n#Person1#: Well. You .. It's a ... It's just a marital relations class. You know about finding a partner. You know, mom's always, you know, on me about that. What does it matter to you anyway?\n#Person2#: Forty dollars? That's a little expense.\n#Person1#: Well, they guarantee results, but ah, never mind. You would never understand.\n#Person2#: What about this one? Introduction to Gourmet Cooking? Why did you take this class? You hate cooking.\n#Person1#: Well, um, I have a friend who's into cooking, and she's [She?] ... I mean, my friend's taking the class. I mean, ugh, does it really matter?\n#Person2#: A marriage class ... a close female friend ... a cooking textbook ... I think I get the picture. Mom's going to be excited about this.\n#Person1#: Ah, you got it all wrong. So, do you want to buy any of these textbooks or not?
#Person1#: Hello. I'd like a copy of the brochure, please. How much is that?\n#Person2#: It's free. There's one map inside.\n#Person1#: Oh. Thank you very much. Look, I'm only here for three days. What are the best places to see?\n#Person2#: Well... There is a lot you could do. Are you interested in visiting some outlying islands such as Lantau?\n#Person1#: Outlying islands?\n#Person2#: Yes, there are a lot of interesting things you can see there; there are old villages and temples. And the scenery is very nice. This brochure tells you more. You could think about it.\n#Person1#: Well... I will. Thanks very much indeed!\n#Person2#: You're welcome.
#Person1#: So, have you found a job yet?\n#Person2#: No, but, I have a few leads, so things are looking up.\n#Person1#: But isn't that what you always say?\n#Person2#: Well ... uh ... this time is different.\n#Person1#: What are you looking for this time, then?\n#Person2#: Actually, I want to work for a Web hosting company.\n#Person1#: What would you do there?\n#Person2#: Well, in a nut shell, Web hosting companies provide space for people to store and run their Websites. Does it sound like I know what I'm talking about?\n#Person1#: Oh, yeah, sort of.\n#Person2#: Well, And then, sort of? Well, they allow people to run their Web sites without having to buy and maintain their own servers, and I'd like to work in technical support, you know, helping customers resolve computer-related problems with their sites. And you know I'm a good communicator.\n#Person1#: So, how's the pay for that kind of job?\n#Person2#: Well, most people I know start out with a very reasonable salary; you can earn pay increases depending on your performance.\n#Person1#: So, what about benefits?\n#Person2#: Oh, the benefits are pretty good. They provide health insurance, two weeks of paid vacation a year, and opportunities for advancement. And in the end, I'd like to work in a management position. You know, sitting back, enjoying the view out of the twentieth-story window of the office building. Something like that.\n#Person1#: Well, is there any long-term job security in a job like that?\n#Person2#: Uhh. That's hard to tell. I mean, the Internet is booming, and these kinds of companies are sprouting up everywhere, which is a good thing, but just like the dot-com era, you never know how long things will last.\n#Person1#: Well, have you ever thought about going back to school to improve your job skills?\n#Person2#: Wait, wait. What are you suggesting?\n#Person1#: Well, you know, more training might help you land a better job.\n#Person2#: Wh ... wh ... Are you trying to say something about my current job? I mean, is there something going on here? I mean, what are you saying?\n#Person1#: You know, you did drop out of college.\n#Person2#: I know, I know, but I don't know. I'm just seeing my current job at McDonalds as a step up. [McDonalds!]. Yeah, but, you know, I don't have the resources to go back to school at the moment; however, the job I am looking at will pay for some classes after I have been with the company for six months.\n#Person1#: Well, it looks like you have things planned out this time.\n#Person2#: If I last that long.
#Person1#: What stresses you out the most? \n#Person2#: Probably my parents. \n#Person1#: How so? \n#Person2#: Well, during school, they wanted good grades. Then after I got a job, they wanted me to get a better job. And finally, they want me to get married. \n#Person1#: You have to deal with a lot of pressure from your parents. \n#Person2#: Your parents are not like that? \n#Person1#: Ever since I brought home some bad grades in elementary school, they never expected much. \n#Person2#: You're lucky. \n#Person1#: What do you do to deal with the stress? \n#Person2#: Not much I can do. It's always there. I sometimes go out with some friends and drink, but that's only a temporary solution. The stress always returns in the morning. \n#Person1#: That sucks. You wanna go grab a beer? \n#Person2#: Sure. Sounds great. Let's go. 
#Person1#: Can you suggest a few exercise to help me get fit and stretch my muscles a littlt? \n#Person2#: Sure. If you want to stretch your legs, a good exercise is to lift your knee in front of your body, like this. It's a very simple exercise, but very effective. \n#Person1#: I need to excise my arms too. How can I do that? \n#Person2#: One good way is to do push-ups. Another way is to use weights. Make sure you grip the weights firmly. You don't want to drop them on your feet! \n#Person1#: When I do push-ups, should I bend my elbows so that my nose touches the ground? \n#Person2#: You don't need to bend your elbows that much. Bend them so that your arms are at a 90 degree angle. The most important think is to remember to keep your body straight. Many people bend their bodies at the waist, which reduces the effectiveness of the exercise. \n#Person1#: What's a good exercise for my chest muscles? \n#Person2#: One that I recommend is that you lie on your back. You should have a weight in each hand and stretch your arms out either side of your body. \n#Person1#: So I need plenty of space for this exercise. \n#Person2#: Yes, you do. Lift the weight up, keeping your arms straight all the time. \n#Person1#: Great. Thanks for you advice! 
#Person1#: I haven't told you what happened yet, have I? \n#Person2#: I haven't heard anything. \n#Person1#: My boss offered me a promotion, and I took it. \n#Person2#: Are you serious? \n#Person1#: Yes, I am really excited. \n#Person2#: That's great. Congratulations. \n#Person1#: I appreciate that. \n#Person2#: You have no idea how happy I am for you. \n#Person1#: For real? \n#Person2#: I believe you were the best choice for that promotion. I really do. 
#Person1#: Well, you seem to enjoy speaking English. \n#Person2#: You can't help learning when you're using it all day. You'll see. A few weeks' study in the school will have a similar effect on you. \n#Person1#: I hope so. You see, at the moment I find it difficult to get used to the teacher's speed and accent. I'm awfully worried, I can't reply as quickly as she seems to expect. \n#Person2#: Oh, she likes keeping us on our toes by getting us use English throughout the class. She doesn't mind your making mistakes, though. \n#Person1#: You know, speaking in class is a very good chance to put your English to practical use. 
#Person1#: Good morning, sir. Can I help you?\n#Person2#: Yes, good morning. I'd like to buy a copy of today's Morning Post.\n#Person1#: Yes, here it is.\n#Person2#: Thank you. How much is it?\n#Person1#: Morning Post is one dollar.\n#Person2#: One dollar? OK, I'm also looking for the New Yorker's. Do you have it?\n#Person1#: Yes, certaninly, sir. Here is the latest issue.\n#Person2#: How much is it?\n#Person1#: That's 2.5 dollars.\n#Person2#: 2.5 dollars. OK, I'll take both of them.\n#Person1#: One newspaper and one magazine, it's 3.5 dollars. Thank you very much, sir.
#Person1#: Hello, this is the International Student Office. This is Leah. How may I help you?\n#Person2#: This is Nathaniel Brown, from English Department. I'd like to speak to Miss Collins about my accommodation situation.\n#Person1#: Well, I'm sorry. She is out for lunch at the moment. Can I take a message?\n#Person2#: Sure. Can you have her call me back on my cell phone number?\n#Person1#: OK. What's your number?\n#Person2#: It's 07787367688.\n#Person1#: Let me repeat that to you. That's 077873676688, right?\n#Person2#: No, there's no double 6. It's just 07787367688.\n#Person1#: I got it. When should I have her call you back?\n#Person2#: Anytime before 6:00 PM tonight.\n#Person1#: OK, Nathaniel. I'll have Miss Collins call you back sometime tonight before 6:00 PM.
#Person1#: My doctor says I need an outside interest to get my mind off my work. Can you suggest a hobby?\n#Person2#: Well, electronics might be fun, but you don't want a hobby that requires a lot of expensive equipment, do you?\n#Person1#: No, I don't want to buy expensive equipment. I just want to do something that is relaxing and enjoyable. Do you think collecting umbrellas would be interesting?\n#Person2#: Collecting umbrellas? I've heard of a lot of unusual hobbies, but I've never heard of that one. You don't play a musical instrument, do you?\n#Person1#: Yes, I play the violin, but I want to do something different. What's your hobby?\n#Person2#: My hobby is stamp collecting. I've been collecting stamps since my childhood. And it's a lot of fun. Have you ever had a stamp collection?\n#Person1#: No. I've never had a stamp collection. It's difficult and it takes a long time to build a good stamp collection, doesn't it?\n#Person2#: Yes, building a good collection takes a long time. But a rare set of stamps can be very valuable. I can see that you're not interested in stamp collecting. So how about sports?\n#Person1#: Yes, I am interested in sports. I want something I can do on weekends. Do you think golf would take my mind off my job?\n#Person2#: Yes, I think it would.
#Person1#: Lucy, you're back. What classes did you have?\n#Person2#: Well, I had English from 9:00 to 10:30, art from 13:30 to 15:00. And math from 15:45 to 17:15.\n#Person1#: What do you think of the teachers?\n#Person2#: To be honest, I like all of them except the math teacher. Though he must be quite young, he seems like an old person. He's so boring.\n#Person1#: That's too bad. How is your English teacher?\n#Person2#: She is great. In today's class, she gave us a lecture on how to be a good student. She told us not to push ourselves hard for exams, but to pay more attention to communicating than memorizing.\n#Person1#: Did she give you any homework?\n#Person2#: Not today, she wanted us to relax tonight instead of doing homework.\n#Person1#: No wonder you like the class so much.
#Person1#: Hey, taxi! Ah, great! Thanks for stopping.\n#Person2#: Where to?\n#Person1#: Well, I'm going to the National Museum of Art. How long does it take to get there?\n#Person2#: Well, that all depends on the traffic, but it shouldn't take more than 30 minutes.\n#Person1#: Oh, by the way, do you know what time the museum closes?\n#Person2#: Well, I would guess around 6 o'clock. Is this your first time to the city?\n#Person1#: Yeah, do you know any good restaurants downtown that offer meals at a reasonable price?\n#Person2#: Uhm...Well, the Mexican restaurant La Fajita. It's not as inexpensive as other places I know, but the service is better.
#Person1#: Hello, Globe Hotel. Can I help you?\n#Person2#: Yes, I have a reservation from the eighteenth to the twenty-first July for a double room with bath and balcony. I would like to change it from the eighteenth to the twenty-third July.\n#Person1#: And your name, Please?\n#Person2#: Bouvier.\n#Person1#: I'll check it for you. I'm sorry, the room is not available on the twenty-third. But the twenty-second is available, will that be OK?\n#Person2#: That's OK. I'll check out before noon on the twenty-third.
#Person1#: Our luggage hasn't arrived.\n#Person2#: Are you with Sunny Times Tours?\n#Person1#: Yes, Mr. and Mrs. Cameron.\n#Person2#: And which flat were you on, Mrs. Cameron?\n#Person1#: The fast jet flight from Manchester to Berlin. I think it's FJ2498.\n#Person2#: It seems some bags have gone to another airport.\n#Person1#: Do you know which airport are bags have gone to?\n#Person2#: I'm afraid the luggage has gone to Rome.\n#Person1#: Rome? Well, how did that happen?\n#Person2#: I'm not sure, but all the missing bags are coming on the next flight. Which hotel are you staying at? Your bags will go there directly.\n#Person1#: But all our summer clothes are in the suitcases.
#Person1#: Hello, Michelle. How are you feeling today?\n#Person2#: Hi, Doctor Frank, I am not feeling very well. That is why I made an appointment with you.\n#Person1#: I am sorry to hear that. What seems to be the trouble?\n#Person2#: My head has been hurting a lot lately. I never used to feel like this.\n#Person1#: When does it hurt the most?\n#Person2#: Usually I feel fine. It only hurts when I am in class. My head starts hurting when I try to copy notes from the board. I tried sitting near the back of the room, but it doesn't help. In fact, it gets worse.\n#Person1#: Well, it sounds like you might need glasses. You should get your eyes checked. It should not take too long.\n#Person2#: Thank you, doctor. I appreciate your help.
#Person1#: Hello, this is Hilton Hotel. How may I help you?\n#Person2#: Hi. I would like to make a reservation on this Friday.\n#Person1#: OK. What kind of room do you want? We have single rooms, twin rooms, double rooms and suites available on Friday.\n#Person2#: I want a single room with ocean view. Do you have one?\n#Person1#: Let me check. Yes.\n#Person2#: OK. I will take it.\n#Person1#: When do you check in? How long are you planning to stay? Do you have any special requirements?\n#Person2#: I guess I am going to arrive at 9:00 in the morning and I would like to leave at 200 in the afternoon on Sunday. Please give me a room away from the elevator. I hate noises while I am sleeping.\n#Person1#: OK. No problem.
#Person1#: I have here our price sheet on a F. O. B. basis. The prices are given without engagement.\n#Person2#: Good, if you ' ll excuse me, I ' ll go over the sheet right now.\n#Person1#: Take your time.\n#Person2#: I can tell you at a glance that your prices are much too high.\n#Person1#: I ' m surprised to hear you say so. You know that the cost of pro - duction has been skyrocketing in recent years.\n#Person2#: We only ask that your prices be comparable to others. That ' s reasonable, isn ' t it?\n#Person1#: Well, to get the business done, we can consider making some concessions in our price. But first, you ' ll have to give me an idea of the quantity you wish to order from us, so that we may adjust our prices accordingly.\n#Person2#: The size of our order depends greatly on the prices. Let ' s settle that matter first.\n#Person1#: Well, as I ' Ve said, if your order is large enough, we ' re ready to reduce our prices by 2 percent.\n#Person2#: When I say your prices are much too high, I don ' t mean they are higher merely by 2 or 3 percent.\n#Person1#: How much do you mean then? Can you give me a rough idea?\n#Person2#: To have this business concluded, I should say a reduction of least 10 percent would help.\n#Person1#: Impossible. How can you expect us to make a reduction to that extent?\n#Person2#: I think you are as well - informed as I am about the market for chemical fertilizers. It ' s unnecessary for me to point out that sup - ply exceeds demand at present and that this situation is apt to continue for a long time yet. May I suggest that you call your home office and see what they have to say?\n#Person1#: Very well, I will.
#Person1#: Margaret, I'd like to follow up with the arrangements for our company retreat, to take place next month. We need to book the venue, make arrangements for speakers and door prizes, and set up all the activities and accommodations. Also, very important, we need to determine which of our staff will be eligible and will be available to go. We've got to get a head count in order to make reservations.\n#Person2#: What's the criteria for staff to attend? Are we only including our management team in this affair? Or will we be extending invitations to lower level employees to attend?\n#Person1#: Lower level employees need not attend. The purpose of this retreat is for training, especially for our management team. We want to develop a well-oiled machine on our executive level. In order to get everyone to jell together, we've got to include some fun. That's the reason for the retreat.
#Person1#: Excuse me, does this bus go to the new bookstore?\n#Person2#: No, you'll have to get off at the bank, and take a No. 50.\n#Person1#: Thank you. How much is the fare to that stop?\n#Person2#: One dollar.\n#Person1#: How many stops are there?\n#Person2#: Two stops after this one.\n#Person1#: Could you please tell me when we get there?\n#Person2#: Sure.\n#Person1#: By the way, do I need a transfer again after No. 50?\n#Person2#: No, a No. 50 will take you right there.\n#Person1#: Thank you.
#Person1#: Hey, you look great! how's everything?\n#Person2#: Yeah, you know what? I've been going to the club regularly. The training really pays off. Now I am in a good shape and I know more about how to keep fit.\n#Person1#: Really? tell me about it. I haven't gone to the club for a long time. I am too busy with work.\n#Person2#: It's important to do proper exercises.\n#Person1#: You're right. Too much or too little won't do any good.\n#Person2#: The trainer tells me, besides regular sports activities, I should also have a healthy and balanced diet.\n#Person1#: Sounds reasonable.\n#Person2#: We should eat more vegetables instead of junk food to stay energetic.\n#Person1#: And fruits!\n#Person2#: Surely it is. Getting enough sleep is also crucial for fitness.\n#Person1#: I've heard that. Does your trainer tell you anything about keeping fit?\n#Person2#: Yeah, he advises me to stay in a good mood. That can also help one to keep sound physical health.\n#Person1#: I think if you follow your trainer's advice, you'll be on the right track.\n#Person2#: You bet it!
#Person1#: I think you're being a little naive.\n#Person2#: If I want, I can protect myself by paying through an escrow account, which holds the money until I receive the item.\n#Person1#: That proves my point! Protect yourself or you'll get burned.\n#Person2#: eBay also offers free insurance. You can get a refund of up to $ 200 if you're not satisfied with your purchase.\n#Person1#: $ 200? If they get a hold of your credit card number, you're going to be out a lot more than $ 200! I had a friend who...
#Person1#: Sam, you'Ve got to forgive me.\n#Person2#: Forgive you for what?\n#Person1#: I used your computer. And I'm afraid I'Ve erased your personal files accidentally.\n#Person2#: No! Are you kidding me?\n#Person1#: I'm afraid not. I apologize.\n#Person2#: I can't believe it! I have all my important personal documents stored in that computer. It's no laughing matter.\n#Person1#: I told you I'm sorry. What can I do to make it up to you?\n#Person2#: Well, you should be sorry! Don't ever use my computer again! You can't do anything now, it's too late!
#Person1#: You have done an excellent job this year and we are pleased with the results.\n#Person2#: I am glad that you have been happy with my performance.\n#Person1#: As a result of your performance, we are happy to offer you the position of manager.\n#Person2#: Does this title come with an increase in salary?\n#Person1#: Yes, it does.\n#Person2#: Can you give me the specifics?\n#Person1#: Your monthly gross salary will increase by $ 500.\n#Person2#: That sounds fair.
#Person1#: Do you buy that newspaper every day?\n#Person2#: Yes, I do. I find it very informative. It always has plenty of articles from correspondents all over the world and the business section is very useful too.\n#Person1#: Is there a Sunday edition of that newspaper?\n#Person2#: Yes. There is. it has several sections, so it's quite a read! It usually takes me a few hours to read it on Sunday morning.\n#Person1#: What section does it have?\n#Person2#: Let me see. There's the news section, the entertainment section, sports, business, and world affairs.\n#Person1#: What's in that section?\n#Person2#: World affairs? They look at the most important stories in more detail. I find it fascinating. Do you buy a daily paper?\n#Person1#: I buy a national newspaper sometimes, buy I nearly always buy a local evening newspaper. I find the local news more interesting than national or international news.
#Person1#: What are you doing now, Steven?\n#Person2#: I am reading a book about money management.\n#Person1#: Oh, my God. Do you want to be a millionaire? I can see you are very crazy about money.\n#Person2#: Everyone wants to earn a lot of money. Don't you think so? What's more, I am interested in money management.\n#Person1#: No, you are wrong. Money can't buy happiness and health. I won't sacrifice my health in order to get money. In other words, I don't want to be a millionaire and I want to have more free time to enjoy life.\n#Person2#: Oh, I see. But a proverb says ' Money makes the mare go. ' I think it will be better if you have more money.\n#Person1#: Maybe you are right. Please take care of yourself when you make money. Anyway health is the most important thing.\n#Person2#: Thank you for your caring. I will.\n#Person1#: No thanks.
#Person1#: It's so relaxing, taking a walk in the country. The air is so fresh and clean.\n#Person2#: would you like to live in the country? I'm not sure I'd like it.\n#Person1#: I can see a lot of advantage and disadvantage. The problem is that, for me, each advantage has its own disadvantage.\n#Person2#: What do you mean?\n#Person1#: Well, I hate the noise in the city, but I love being around lost of people. The problem is that you can't have lots of people and have peace and quiet. The two just don't go together.\n#Person2#: I see what you mean. I love being far away from a city, but I hate being so far away department stores and sports facilities.\n#Person1#: People can't have it both ways. If you live in the country, it is often less convenient. If you live in a city, it is noisy, but there's more to do.\n#Person2#: I would love to be surrounded by hills and streams. They're so much better to look at than concrete, rows of parked cars and tall buildings.\n#Person1#: I would love to hear the birds singing and feel the fresh breeze on my face. When the wind blows in the city, you get dust in your mouth and in your eyes.\n#Person2#: The view from the hill is so beautiful and relaxing. There's so sign of pollution. The village looks so peaceful.\n#Person1#: Just remember that in that village there's nothing to do. There's not even a pub or restaurant. There's just one small shop with a poor selection of goods.\n#Person2#: You're right. I would have to travel to the city at least once a week to go shopping and see friends. I would hate living in the country!
#Person1#: Do you believe in UFO's?\n#Person2#: Sure. A UFO is just a space vehicle from another planet. If you think about it, our space shuttles are UFOs.\n#Person1#: I've never thought about it like that before.\n#Person2#: I've seen photos of UFOs in America before, but they've all looked doctored up.\n#Person1#: Do you think that there's life on other planets?\n#Person2#: I think there must be.\n#Person1#: Why is that?\n#Person2#: I don't't think it would make sense if we were the only beings in this whole world. The world is just far too big for that.\n#Person1#: Do you think that there's intelligent life trying to contact us?\n#Person2#: No, but we're trying to contact them.\n#Person1#: I suppose you're right.\n#Person2#: I think that countries are working hard to find a planet that we can live on in the future so that when global warming destroys this planet, humankind will not become extinct.\n#Person1#: Do you really think that global warming Wil destroy Earth some day?\n#Person2#: There's a lot of evidence that suggest it will, but I don't think it's going to happen any time soon.
#Person1#: What do you think of the novel you just finished reading?\n#Person2#: I like it a lot. It has a very funny beginning, I think. It attracts your attention the moment you begin reading it.\n#Person1#: What do you like best about it?\n#Person2#: I like the plot. It's so full of twists and turns. I also like the main character. She is so humorous and smart.\n#Person1#: What do you think of the ending?\n#Person2#: The ending is a bit weak. It's so abrupt, like those of most other detective stories.

Every girl on the campus has a crush on those handsome guys.\n#Person2#: I'll surely make introductions for them.
#Person1#: I have a bone to pick with you.\n#Person2#: Okay. Let's clear the air. What are you getting at?\n#Person1#: You always have a chip on your shoulder.\n#Person2#: I'm sorry. But I don't meant to get your goat.
#Person1#: Can you read what this says?\n#Person2#: Yes, and you could too if your hair wasn't hanging down in your face.\n#Person1#: Don't dis my hair! I like it like this.\n#Person2#: You like it, but it's getting to be a handicap for you.\n#Person1#: Hey, that's enough about my hair.\n#Person2#: I know a great hairdresser not far from here and she is cute too.\n#Person1#: I don't go to hairdressers because they're cute.\n#Person2#: Did I mention she's good at cutting hair too?
#Person1#: Do you use an anti-virus program to protect your computer?\n#Person2#: Yes, I do. I also use an anti-spyware program and a firewall. There are so many nasties on the internet and so many people who are trying to use the internet to hurt other users. You have to be very careful and keep you computer clean.\n#Person1#: How often do you run your anti-virus program?\n#Person2#: I usually run it every few days. It finds a virus about half the time.\n#Person1#: Which anti-virus program would you recommend?\n#Person2#: How you tried this one? It's very good and you can download it for free on the internet. You can also download updates for free.\n#Person1#: That sounds very good. Which website should I visit to download it?\n#Person2#: Just a minute. . . go to this one. I'll send you an email with the line in it. It only takes a few minutes to download. Then you have to go through the set up procedures. But they are not complicated.\n#Person1#: What do you use your computer for?\n#Person2#: I use it for several things-surfing the net, word processing and creating presentations. I don't play many games on my computer, but I do a lot of work with photographs. Using c computer program, you can edit and resize photographs. You can also make them brighter or darker and cut pieces from different photographs to create new ones.\n#Person1#: Computers are great, aren't they? I should download some program and learn how to use them.
#Person1#: Is this the class to prepare for interviews?\n#Person2#: This is the right place. Please join us.\n#Person1#: I have an interview tomorrow, so I hope I can learn everything quickly.\n#Person2#: We are all going to have great interviews. What are some things that we need to remember in an interview?\n#Person1#: I think that we should make sure that our looks are the best they can be.\n#Person2#: Right, and what about our friendliness and attitude?\n#Person1#: Yes, and being friendly and having a good attitude also help me relax.\n#Person2#: Did you know that they pay as much attention to what you ask as to what you say in an interview?\n#Person1#: No, I didn't. What else should I keep in mind?\n#Person2#: Just relax, listen carefully to the questions, and be honest in your responses.
#Person1#: Could I see the manager please? I have a complaint to make.\n#Person2#: Yes, I'm the manager here. What can I do for you, Madam?\n#Person1#: Did you have the room checked before we move in?\n#Person2#: Which room are you in?\n#Person1#: 1808. The toilet doesn't work properly. The water doesn't run in the shower.\n#Person2#: I'm awfully sorry to hear that. ( After checking ) I'll turn to it right away. I do apologize. We'll change your room to 2002.\n#Person1#: That's not bad. Thanks for your help.\n#Person2#: It's my pleasure, Madam.

Let me get your meat.
#Person1#: Who finances the magazine?\n#Person2#: I don't know exactly. I only hear it's financed by a famous film star.\n#Person1#: Does it have a large circulation?\n#Person2#: Yes, so it really doesn't matter who offers the money. The paper itself is profitable.
#Person1#: Would you like this one?\n#Person2#: I don't think that will do. How about the one at your back?\n#Person1#: This one?\n#Person2#: No, the other one. . . yes.\n#Person1#: This one is especially built for hard, continuous play. And every detail of workmanship and material has been carefully checked to make it a dependable one for tournament use.\n#Person2#: It do look beautiful. Well. I think I'll take it. Now do you have any racket covers?\n#Person1#: This cover comes with the racket.\n#Person2#: How much does it come up to?\n#Person1#: The mark says six hundred yuan, plus tax, it's six hundred and eighty yuan.\n#Person2#: Do you accept credit cards?\n#Person1#: Sure.

#Person1#: Excuse me may I know the name of your corporation?\n#Person2#: China National Textiles Import and Export Corporation\n#Person1#: We found your samples very attractive. We're interested in buying your garments if your prices are reasonable\n#Person2#: Our products are of good quality. Since the prices of textiles have gone up in the world market we've had to increase them on some items by about ten percent. If you place a large order it is possible for us to cut down the prices by five percent\n#Person1#: Can I have a reduction of seven percent?\n#Person2#: It depends on how much you order\n#Person1#: Can I use the FAS terms?\n#Person2#: I'd rather use the CIF terms.

#Person1#: Sir, I've finished your shaving. Wow, it takes years off you after having a shave.\n#Person2#: Really? You've done a good job.\n#Person1#: Thank you. May I suggest you to trim your eyebrows?\n#Person2#: I have never heard that men would trim their eyebrows. Are you kidding?\n#Person1#: No, sir, I am serious. Haven't you heard that today men are becoming increasingly interested in having their eyebrows professionally groomed?\n#Person2#: Do you mean that it is a trend for men to trim their eyebrows?\n#Person1#: Absolutely. Several men have tried it in my A shop. Do you want to try?\n#Person2#: Yeah, let me have a try.
#Person1#: Hey, Robert, that's a nice shirt you are wearing. Where did you get it?\n#Person2#: thanks, I like it too. I bought it at the nearby department store.\n#Person1#: that's nice. Do you know you can get one at the wholesale market near the zoo for a much lower price?\n#Person2#: yeah, I know that. But at those places. the prices they ask you are ridiculously high, and if you don't bargain hard, you will get ripped-off.\n#Person1#: true, learning how to haggle the price is one of the things people have to pick up when they come to China for the first time.\n#Person2#: yeah, but personally, I hate bargaining. If I bargain, I might come to a lower price, but I will never know the true price of what I am buying ; and I always have the feeling that I am overcharged at th\n#Person1#: yeah, I have the same feeling. Also there is another thing that bothers me the quality. Things in a department store are usually quality-guaranteed. But at a wholesale market, you never know whether w\n#Person2#: that's why I like department stores more. Shopping at a wholesale market like the locals is one of the few things I am unable to grow accustomed to.\n#Person1#: I understand. While it's always good to follow the local customs, I guess there are exceptions.
#Person1#: Excuse me. My bag was stolen. Will you help me?\n#Person2#: When did it happen?\n#Person1#: Just about half an hour ago.\n#Person2#: Tell me where it happened and how?\n#Person1#: Yes.

#Person1#: Why do you want to work in our company?\n#Person2#: Well, there are 2 reasons. First of all, I'm itching to work in a foreign enterprise.

That would be very nice. Let me tell you what to do first.

What would you like today? Would you like to try the one-pound super hot and spicy cheeseburger?\n#Person2#: Uh. I don't think so. I'd probably have heartburn for a week after downing that monster.\n#Person1#: Well. It's our house special this week, and it comes with fries, and a large specialty drink called 'Everything-but-the-kitchen-sink.'\n#Person2#: A what? 'Everything-but-the-kitchen-sink'? What in the world is that?\n#Person1#: Well, it's a little mix of everything in a large cup: Pepsi, Sprite, Fanta Orange, and lemonade with crushed ice and a scoop of ice cream.\n#Person2#: Ah, that sounds disgusting.\n#Person1#: Hey, it'll grow on you.\n#Person2#: Nay, I think I'll just order a hamburger with some mustard and lettuce and a glass of water.\n#Person1#: Boring. Hey. Would you care for anything else like a side order of amazing cheesy onion rings?\n#Person2#: No thank you. Onion rings usually don't agree with me.\n#Person1#: Hmm. Okay. Your total comes to ten ninety ($10.90).\n#Person2#: Ten ninety? For just a hamburger?! You've got to be kidding\n#Person1#: Well, the one-pound super deluxe hamburger is nine dollars.\n#Person2#: Hey, I didn't order a one-pound burger. I just wanted a simple burger. That's all.\n#Person1#: Well, sir. Joe's Hamburger Restaurant only serves one-pound burgers. [Man!] The one-pound super hot and spicy, the one-pound barbecue burger, the one-pound bacon cheese burger, the one-pound ...\n#Person2#: No, no. Those are all huge.\n#Person1#: Well, sir. If you really want something smaller [Yeah], you should order from the kids' menu: The half-pound super hot and spicy burger, the half-pound barbecue burger, the half-pound bacon cheese burger, the half-pound ...\n#Person2#: No. Those are still giant burgers.\n#Person1#: Well, in these parts, we are hearty eaters.\n#Person2#: Okay, but you said my total was ten ninety, but the burger only comes to ten bucks. What about the other ninety cents?\n#Person1#: Well, sir. We only serve natural spring water from yonder hills, and ...\n#Person2#: Okay, okay. I'll take the giant burger and a bottle of your spring water. The sandwich should feed me for a week.
#Person1#: Hello! I haven't seen you before.\n#Person2#: I'm new here. I have just arrived at this school.\n#Person1#: Really? Let me take you to your class. Which class are you in?\n#Person2#: I don't know.\n#Person1#: Never mind. I will show you to the teachers' office. Come with me.\n#Person2#: Thanks! Oh, by the way, I don't know where to put this bike.\n#Person1#: Oh, you have got a bike, haven't you? You can put it over there.\n#Person2#: It is very kind of you. Thank you.\n#Person1#: Not at all. This way, please.
#Person1#: Chris,I would like to know, what kind of food you eat in Belgium.\n#Person2#: We have our fish, our meat, our wines, our fruit ...\n#Person1#: I mean what is popular about Belgian food?\n#Person2#: Well, it's a bit different in Belgium as I think it is here in New York. We really enjoy the tables. We don't go out for dinner that often but when we go out we stay at a table for three or four hours. It starts with appetizers, then it may be a soup, then it's the main dish, then it's still an ice-cream or something.\n#Person1#: It takes so much time to have dinner in your country!\n#Person2#: Yeah. We really enjoy eating and it goes slow. Last winter, a friend from Portugal went to Belgium with me. For Christmas dinner, we met at 5:30 and then we started with some drinks. I think we ate from 6 o'clock in the afternoon till 12 o'clock that night.\n#Person1#: Wow! You must be fat there if you eat that much.\n#Person2#: In fact we don't. We don't do it that often, but if we do, then of course the next day or the next few days you see people just don't eat much.
#Person1#: It's quite clear form my visit, this is a full size, comprehensive university. So why is it still called a college?\n#Person2#: The College of William and Mary is the second oldest institution of higher learning in this country.

Can you manage this afternoon?\n#Person2#: I'm afraid not. 1 can manage tomorrow.\n#Person1#: I'm afraid Mr. Milton is not on duty tomorrow. He'll be here the day after tomorrow. That's Thursday, March 27th.\n#Person2#: Fine.\n#Person1#: Will 5:20 be all right?\n#Person2#: Well, yes. But what time is the clinic closed?\n#Person1#: We start from 9:00 a.m. and close at 7:00 p. m. on weekdays. We don't work at the weekend.\n#Person2#: I'd prefer a later time so that I can come along after work.\n#Person1#: Then what about 6:15?\n#Person2#: Well, that's fine.
#Person1#: I don't want to go to the beach tomorrow.\n#Person2#: Why not? It's not going to rain, is it? There is no cloud in the sky and it's going to be clear.\n#Person1#: That's right. I don't want to get burnt.
#Person1#: What are pubs?\n#Person2#: Pubs in England are friendly and warm places where you can have a drink and usually a simple meal.\n#Person1#: What kind of drinks do people get?\n#Person2#: You can get wine and beer in most pubs. Many also serve coffee. You go to the counter to order and pay for your drinks.\n#Person1#: When do people go to the pubs?\n#Person2#: Pubs are not open all day. They can decide when to open. Most are open for 3 or 4 hours at lunchtime and again from about 6:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m. In busy areas, pubs may stay open from 11:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m. Are there pubs in China?\n#Person1#: Yes. Most of the customers are young people. They like to hang out with their friends after work and have fun.\n#Person2#: It is against the law in England to go into a pub if you are under the age of l4. So many pubs provide a special room for children.
#Person1#: What do you want to do this weekend?\n#Person2#: Oh, I don't know. Maybe go to the beach if it's nice weather.\n#Person1#: But we did that last weekend. Let's do something different.\n#Person2#: Hum... Hey, I know what! Why don't we climb Mt. Fuji?\n#Person1#: Great idea! I've always wanted to do that!\n#Person2#: Paul and Mary talked about a bicycle ride yesterday, but they haven't made the final decision. Maybe we could persuade them to join us.\n#Person1#: Wonderful! I give them a call right now.
#Person1#: Hi, Ann. Are you still working here?\n#Person2#: Oh, hi, Jack. Yes, I'm still working part-time in a company, as much as I can. The trouble is that I'm so busy with my classes that I don't have enough time for my work.\n#Person1#: Do you have a lot to do?\n#Person2#: Well, not too much at the moment.\n#Person1#: Are you going to go on working in that company?\n#Person2#: I hope so. I really like my work, and next term, I will have more time.\n#Person1#: Sounds good. Hope I'll see you around here more often.\n#Person2#: OK. I hope to see yon too. Bye for now.
#Person1#: You know. I called you several times last week, but nobody answered the phone.\n#Person2#: Well, I was in Sydney at that time.\n#Person1#: Did you go there on business?\n#Person2#: No, I visited my aunt and her family.
#Person1#: Excuse me, sir, but you have to put your bags here before entering the market. \n#Person2#: Oh. I am sorry. I was busy looking for some whisky. Can you tell me the exactly place where I can find any? \n#Person1#: Yes, it's on the third floor. 
#Person1#: Good afternoon, Steven. Are you coming to class today? We missed you in the lab yesterday.\n#Person2#: Uh...Sorry, Miss Smith. I had a mid term exam for my literature course and I... I had to do some last minute revision for it. Yes, I will certainly be at the class today, though. Sorry, I missed the experiment yesterday.\n#Person1#: Hmm...I don't really think reviewing for an English literature exam is a very good excuse, do you?\n#Person2#: No, you're right. It isn't a good excuse at all. It's just that I did a very similar experiment in chemistry 101 last time, so I felt I probably wouldn't miss too much.
#Person1#: Ground Transportation Services,how can I help you?\n#Person2#: I have 7 guests coming to visit for the holidays. And I want to know how I can get them from the airport to my house.\n#Person1#: OK, are you familiar with our door to door shuttle service?\n#Person2#: Yes, I've used it myself. The thing is at $50 a person, that means $350 for 7 people. It's a little expensive.\n#Person1#: How about hiring our minibus?\n#Person2#: How much is it?\n#Person1#: It costs $150 and can drive straight from the airport to your house.\n#Person2#: Oh, that sounds great. Can I make a reservation now?\n#Person1#: Sure, but I'll need the flight information for your guests.\n#Person2#: Sorry, I don't have the information now. I'll call you back.\n#Person1#: OK, goodbye.
#Person1#: Where do we want to go sightseeing today?\n#Person2#: I want to visit this temple I've read about in the guidebook.\n#Person1#: OK. I will buy the entrance ticket.\n#Person2#: Oh, I didn't realize we have to pay to get in.\n#Person1#: In China, there is a small fee to enter museums, parks and temples.\n#Person2#: That's very different from back home. Well, this is my first visit to China and I've heard this temple is amazing. When was it built?\n#Person1#: Pretty recently. About 150 years ago.\n#Person2#: Well, that seems very old to me.\n#Person1#: Considering China's 5000 year old history, it's relatively new.\n#Person2#: Have you been to the temple?\n#Person1#: No, but my parents have. I think we should find a taxi and go.
#Person1#: Are we leaving on Saturday or Sunday?\n#Person2#: We are leaving on Saturday. The plane leaves at midnight, so we're flying over night.\n#Person1#: Oh, really? I'm not sure I can sleep on the plane. It makes me nervous.\n#Person2#: You will be fine. It's easier to sleep than you might think.\n#Person1#: OK, well, what time should we get to the airport?\n#Person2#: I think 10:00 pm will give us enough time. We'll arrive in Thailand at 11:00 pm, their time. And Jenny is picking us up and taking us to the hotel.\n#Person1#: Will aunt Blanca and cousin Matty be there?\n#Person2#: Aunt Bianca will, but cousin Mattie is flying in the next day. Once she arrives, we'll take the train from Bangkok to Chiangmai. Then grandma Sammy is meeting us and we'll take a boat to pick at.\n#Person1#: I'm really excited about this trip. It's going to be so much fun.\n#Person2#: I'm excited too. I hope it's not too tiring with the family.
#Person1#: Good afternoon. This is Michelle Li speaking, calling on behalf of IBA. Is Mr. Meng available at all?\n#Person2#: This is Mr. Meng speaking, Michelle.\n#Person1#: Oh, hello! Sorry about that. I'm just calling to say that we've received your new Corporate Credit Card from HQ.\n#Person2#: That was quick! I wasn't expecting it until later this week.\n#Person1#: Yes, our application procedures have speeded up since we started using the new fast-track system.\n#Person2#: Shall I come in and collect it?\n#Person1#: Or we can send it to you. But if you would like to use it at the ATM, you'll need to wait for your PIN number.\n#Person2#: Mmmm... if I come in and collect it this afternoon, is there any way I could use it today? Petty cash is getting low, so I need to draw some money.\n#Person1#: As long as you bring your ID, etc, we can serve you over the counter. But you won't be able to use the ATM until your new PIN number arrives.\n#Person2#: I see. Yes, that's fine. I'll be there at around 2:30 pm. See you later, and thanks.
#Person1#: Good morning. May I help you?\n#Person2#: Yes. I'm looking for an apartment, I'd like two bedrooms.\n#Person1#: All right. Have a seat, please. Let me ask you a few questions. First of all, may I have your name, please?\n#Person2#: My name's Donald Eakins.\n#Person1#: How do you spell your last name, Mr.Eakins.\n#Person2#: It's E-A-K-I-N-S.\n#Person1#: E-A-K-I-N-S.First name, Donald. And what's your present address, Mr.Eakins?\n#Person2#: It's 1446 Pine Street.\n#Person1#: 1446 Pine. That's in San Francisco, isn't it?\n#Person2#: Yes, it is.
#Person1#: Mike's Mechanics. Can I help you?\n#Person2#: Yes, how do I get to your shop from Chilin?\n#Person1#: Go straight up Zhongshan Road and you will see our sign on your right, after you pass the museum.\n#Person2#: Thank you very much.
#Person1#: Oh, so many kinds of winter hats.\n#Person2#: What is your favorite color, miss?\n#Person1#: Red.\n#Person2#: Here you are. It ' s very attractive.\n#Person1#: May I try it on?\n#Person2#: Go ahead.\n#Person1#: Is there a mirror around here?\n#Person2#: Right over there.\n#Person1#: Does it suit me?\n#Person2#: Yes, you look very nice.\n#Person1#: How much is it?\n#Person2#: We're having a clearance sale. $ 4 plus tax.\n#Person1#: That's quite reasonable.
#Person1#: Have heard of Paul?\n#Person2#: No, what?\n#Person1#: He's got a promotion.\n#Person2#: You're kidding.\n#Person1#: No, they made him vicepresident in charge of sells.\n#Person2#: I don't believe it. He is only being with the company for two years.\n#Person1#: Well, it's true. The board man last thirdly and they choice Paul.\n#Person2#: Well. Good for him.
#Person1#: It's hard to be optimistic about things with the way the economy's headed... The trade deficit is getting larger, consumption's down, I really think we're headed for a recession.\n#Person2#: The economy has been stagnant for a while now. We've been in a recessive state for several months already. What worries me the most is the trade deficit. I think the government should do more to encourage exports.\n#Person1#: Increasing exports would weaken the currency. I think the main point is economic growth. We need more jobs. Factories have outsourced and moved many jobs to foreign countries. The result is an increase in unemployment in our own country, lower consumption, lower production, and an overall feeble economy. If more people are working, it will give the economy a boost.\n#Person2#: It's true that we should do something about unemployment, but what about inflation? If unemployment falls, there's pressure to increase pay. That would result in inflation, which would result in a much less dynamic economy.
#Person1#: Peter, why don't you go outside and play basketball with your friends?\n#Person2#: No, Mum, I'd rather stay inside.\n#Person1#: I just can't understand why you want to stay at home. It is such a wonderful day today.\n#Person2#: I prefer staying at home and watching TV.\n#Person1#: Didn't you just finish watching a basketball game on TV?\n#Person2#: Yes, but a football game is next.\n#Person1#: Oh, Peter. You really should go and play ball yourself rather than watching games.\n#Person2#: I just enjoy watching games.\n#Person1#: You really shouldn't watch so much television.
#Person1#: This is Action 5 News reporter Sarah O'Connell reporting live from Washington, D. C. where a protest has broken out. Thousands of angry citizens are protesting against the proposed bailout of the auto manufacturing industry! Sir, sir, Sarah O'Connell, Action 5 news. Can you tell us what'happening?\n#Person2#: Yeah, yeah, we're here because we feel this is an injustice! The financial irresponsibility of big business has to stop! We're there to show the government that we don't like the way that they're spending our tax dollars!\n#Person1#: Sir but what exactly is making everyone so angry?\n#Person2#: It's an absolute outrage, Sarah, the US government wants to give 25 billion dollars of taxpayers'money to the auto industry. These are companies that have been mismanaged and are now nearly bankrupt.\n#Person1#: I see. But, many supporters of the bailout argue that it could help save the jobs of millions of hardworking Americans.\n#Person2#: That maybe true, and I for one don't want to see anyone lose their job, but how can these Ces ask for a bailout when they're making millions of dollars? And then, they have the nerve to fly to Washington in private jets! This costs hundreds of thousands of dollars! And they're asking for money! That is just not right!\n#Person1#: Good point. This is Sarah O'Connell reporting live from Washington D. C. , back to you, Tom.
#Person1#: Excuse me, I'm looking for a good novel. Can you recommend anything?\n#Person2#: Certainly. What kind of novel did you have in mind?\n#Person1#: I'm not really sure. I don't like romance novels, but any other genre is okay, as long as the book's good.\n#Person2#: Well, let me see. . . This Stephen King novel is a real thriller.\n#Person1#: Sorry, I forgot to mention that I don't like horror much, either.\n#Person2#: That's okay. Well, let me think. How about a mystery novel?\n#Person1#: Hmm. . . I sometimes like mysteries, but I don't think I'm in the mood for one right now.\n#Person2#: There are a number of science fiction and fantasy novels I can recommend.\n#Person1#: I love science fiction and fantasy, but I've been reading a lot of both lately, so I'd prefer to get something else.\n#Person2#: How about a good historical novel? This one set in medieval France is excellent. The story is exciting and the characterization is very well done.\n#Person1#: That sounds interesting. Okay, I'll get this one. Thanks for all your help.\n#Person2#: Don't mention it.
#Person1#: Does this hotel have a pool?\n#Person2#: I'm sorry, sir, we don't have one. However, in our gym, we do have swim stations.\n#Person1#: I'm not sure I understand.\n#Person2#: Think of a deep bathtub that you can swim in, but against a current.\n#Person1#: Cool. What will they think of next? How much are they?\n#Person2#: Sir, guests pay nothing to use the stations.\n#Person1#: Excellent! Now what are the hours?\n#Person2#: The gym is open 24/7, but the stations are open from 7 a. m. to 10 p. m. only.\n#Person1#: I'm going to change into my trunks right now!\n#Person2#: I think you'll like the experience, sir. It's a great workout.
#Person1#: Would you like to go to the natural history museum with me?\n#Person2#: Have you ever been to it before?\n#Person1#: Yes, lots of time. I was quite impressed by the wide variety of exhibitions they have.\n#Person2#: Let's go. It sounds interesting.
#Person1#: What's the time now?\n#Person2#: Sorry, I don't know, there's something wrong with my watch.\n#Person1#: You've simply forgotten to wind it up, have you? When do you usually wind it up?\n#Person2#: In the coming, before going to work.\n#Person1#: You got up so late today. You have, I think. Turn on the TV and set your watch by it.\n#Person2#: OK. I'll turn it on.\n#Person1#: All right. It's just four o'clock.\n#Person2#: Well, I'm setting my watch at four. Thank you.\n#Person1#: You are welcome.
#Person1#: Jane, I was wondering if you you had any plans for saturday afternoon.\n#Person2#: A friend and I are planing to go out, why? what's up?\n#Person1#: There is a special exhibition of french sculptures at the museum, I was hoping you'd like to come with me.\n#Person2#: I am afraid I can't I am going to be out all day.\n#Person1#: What about sunday?\n#Person2#: I wish I could, but it's my mums birthday.\n#Person1#: Maybe next week.\n#Person2#: Much as I'd like to, I am afraid i won't be free next week, I have a lot of work.\n#Person1#: Sorry to hear that, I was really looking forward to spending some more time with you, I really enjoyed our last chat.\n#Person2#: I am really sorry too, maybe I can give you a call sometime.
#Person1#: Which language do you speak?\n#Person2#: Well, I studied French at school, but I've forgotten most of it. I learnt some Russian while I was studying there and now I study Spanish in evening classes. Do you speak Japanese at home with your parents.\n#Person1#: Yes, I do. I'm learning Chinese now on the internet.\n#Person2#: How do you find studying a language on the internet?\n#Person1#: It's not easy, particularly with listening and speaking, because sometimes the connection isn't too good.\n#Person2#: I bet you find the character difficult to write!\n#Person1#: Actually, many of the characters are the same or very similar in both Chinese and Japanese, so they're easy for me.\n#Person2#: So, you can read and write much better than you speak and understand other speakers, right?\n#Person1#: Yes. How are the Spanish classes going?\n#Person2#: In a way, it's similar to your experience of learning Chinese. Some Spanish words are very similar to English ones. But I need to practise listening to native speakers and saying the words myself.
#Person1#: Hi, Mike. We're having a party tonight, wanna come join us? You can bring your girlfriend.\n#Person2#: Well. I am breaking up with Cathy.\n#Person1#: What happened? Did you have a fight?\n#Person2#: No. She is really a very nice girl. . .\n#Person1#: Yeah, she is. She is pretty, caring, getting easy-going and she is a great cook. She is a gem.\n#Person2#: Well, you are right. But sometimes she is too caring. Well, no. . . she's just possessive and I kind of want a break. . . you know. . . for some room for myself.\n#Person1#: Oh? ! Did you talk with her about it?\n#Person2#: I've tried, but it didn't work.\n#Person1#: So, when are you going to tell her?\n#Person2#: Maybe tonight. I don't know. I don't know how to tell her.\n#Person1#: I know she's head over heels in love with you. She will be badly hurt!\n#Person2#: I know. . .
#Person1#: I heard that janet has got a new job. She's working for the united investment group. I hear that they pay very well.\n#Person2#: I heard that too. She must be making a pocket. Well, good for her.\n#Person1#: now, she'll be able to save up for that holiday in the united states.\n#Person2#: yes, she will. At the moment, the exchange rate is very favorable, so she should try to go as soon as possible, while it's cheaper.\n#Person1#: you're right. By the way, did you hear that tom inherited some money recently?\n#Person2#: really? I thought his parents had died several years ago.\n#Person1#: they did. He inherited the money from an uncle. I hope he doesn't lose a lot of it in taxed to the government.\n#Person2#: dying can be very expensive nowadays! What's he going to do with it?\n#Person1#: he said that he would probably invest most of it. He's got a well-paid job, so he doesn't need the money to cover day-to day expenses. He just wants some extra money available for when he retires.\n#Person2#: I had some good financial news yesterday too.\n#Person1#: really? Have you won a fortune in the lottery?\n#Person2#: no, but I got a pay rise of 5 % and a hours for all the hard work I've put in recently. I think it was very nice for my boss to show his appreciation in that way.\n#Person1#: It certainly was! So, what are you going to do with your windfall?
#Person1#: What do you think of studying abroad?\n#Person2#: I think it's a great idea. Studying abroad will offer you plenty of new opportunities. Are you planning on going abroad?\n#Person1#: Yes, I hope so. I am studying for my BELTS right now.\n#Person2#: Which country do you want to go to?\n#Person1#: I'd like to study in the UK, but it's really expensive.\n#Person2#: Have you applied to any schools there?\n#Person1#: Yes, I received a conditional offer from Oxford University a few days ago.\n#Person2#: Congratulations! That's excellent news? What do you have to do to get an unconditional offer?\n#Person1#: I have to get an BELTS score of 7. 5 overall. Do you think I can do that?\n#Person2#: If you study hard, I don't see why you wouldn't. Have you received any other offers?\n#Person1#: I was also accepted into Yale University, and Sydney University.\n#Person2#: If you're worried about money, the cost of living is lowest in America. However, if you go to Oxford University, you'll probably be able to get any job you want in the future.\n#Person1#: I just can't decide where to go. It's not an easy decision to make.\n#Person2#: If I were you, I'd apply for some scholarships and grants before you decide. Whatever you do, I know you'll succeed.
#Person1#: Good morning. I'd like to check out right now.\n#Person2#: May I have your room number . Sir?\n#Person1#: Room 103.\n#Person2#: Just a minute, Sir. Are you Mr. Wang from China?\n#Person1#: Yes. Wang Bin.\n#Person2#: Mr. Wang, did you sign any bill in the last two hours in our hotel?\n#Person1#: No.\n#Person2#: Have you used any hotel services this morning?\n#Person1#: No, I have not.\n#Person2#: Here is your bill. It totals 3250 dollars.\n#Person1#: All right. Can I pay with credit cards?\n#Person2#: What kind of card?\n#Person1#: American Express.\n#Person2#: Yes, we do. Here is your bill and receipt.
#Person1#: Will you look at this form?\n#Person2#: Are you having problems with it?\n#Person1#: I don't understand some things.\n#Person2#: Let me help you.\n#Person1#: What does MI mean?\n#Person2#: MI stands for Middle Initial.\n#Person1#: What does MM / DD / YY mean?\n#Person2#: That means Month / Day / Year. Use numbers.\n#Person1#: I don't understand.\n#Person2#: For example, if your birth date is January 12, 1987, write 01/12 /8 7.\n#Person1#: Oh. That's simple enough.\n#Person2#: Always print clearly, and fill in the bubbles completely.
#Person1#: I was wondering if this is where the Resume Writing Workshop is being held.\n#Person2#: You are in the right place. Please come on in!\n#Person1#: It's been a long time since I've had to look for work and put a resume together.\n#Person2#: It's going to come together just fine. Trust me!\n#Person1#: Where do we begin?\n#Person2#: We start at the top with our name and contact information. Make sure the information is current.\n#Person1#: Then what do we do?\n#Person2#: Put your job experience first, if that is more impressive than your education.\n#Person1#: What about listing my interests and affiliations next?\n#Person2#: Yes, that would make a good ending for your resume.
#Person1#: Oh great! This stupid computer froze again! That's the third time today! Hey Samuel, can you come take a look at my PC? It's acting again. It must have a virus or something.\n#Person2#: Just give me a second. I'll be right up. I ran a virus scan on your computer, and it turns out that you have a lot of infected files!\n#Person1#: But I'm quite careful when I'm browsing the internet, I have no idea how I could have picked up a virus.\n#Person2#: Well, you have to make sure that your anti-virus software is updated regularly, yours wasn't up to date, that's probably what was causing your problems.\n#Person1#: Ok. Anything else?\n#Person2#: Yeah, try not to kick or hit the computer!\n#Person1#: Um yeah. Sorry about that.
#Person1#: You ran into my car.\n#Person2#: That was my fault. I'm sorry.\n#Person1#: You messed up my car.\n#Person2#: I don't see any damage.\n#Person1#: My rear bumper is messed up.\n#Person2#: I don't see anything wrong with it.\n#Person1#: It's smashed in.\n#Person2#: That's not my fault.\n#Person1#: The same thing is wrong with your bumper.\n#Person2#: I'll take care of everything. I just need your phone number and insurance.\n#Person1#: I need your information too.\n#Person2#: Here you go.
#Person1#: Good morning! The Inland hotel. How may I help you?\n#Person2#: Good morning. I'd like to book a room for Friday night and Saturday night.\n#Person1#: Certainly. What kind of room would you like?\n#Person2#: A single room please. I hope you're not fully booked.\n#Person1#: A single room? That's fine. In whose name shall I make the booking?\n#Person2#: Jones. According to your website, the nightly rate is $ 50, including breakfast.\n#Person1#: We offer a 20 % discount for guests staying of Friday and Saturday. The total cost will be $ 80, including breakfast.\n#Person2#: Thank you very much. I look forward to seeing you on Friday.\n#Person1#: Could I just take your credit card number please? I should mention that there is a cancellation charge of $ 20.\n#Person2#: That's fine. My credit card number is. . .
#Person1#: Excuse me. Do you know where I can find the nearest ICCC?\n#Person2#: Yes, but it's quite a ways.\n#Person1#: Do I need to take a bus?\n#Person2#: This bus doesn't take you directly there. You'd have to change buses twice. I suggest you walk. It'll take you less than 20 minutes.\n#Person1#: How do I get there on foot?\n#Person2#: Go straight ahead through the intersection.\n#Person1#: Wait, let me write this down. . . Alright, I'm ready.\n#Person2#: Keep walking till you pass the square, then turn right. Walk past two lights and turn left at the third.\n#Person1#: Square. . . turn right. . . traffic lights. . . And then?\n#Person2#: Keep walking and look for a tall building.\n#Person1#: Tall building. . . Which side is the building on?\n#Person2#: The right side. ICCC should be on the first floor.\n#Person1#: Thank you very much.\n#Person2#: You're welcome.
#Person1#: Where do you wish me to take you, sir?\n#Person2#: Please take us to Harvard University. By the way, is it far from here?\n#Person1#: It takes about half an hour to get there.\n#Person2#: OK.\n#Person1#: Here we are, sir.\n#Person2#: How much do I owe you?\n#Person1#: It's 35 dollars on the meter.\n#Person2#: Here's 50 dollars. Keep the change.\n#Person1#: Thank you. Have a nice day.
#Person1#: Your PC is so amazing. Are you doing trade on internet?\n#Person2#: Thank you for your compliment. I bought this PC with my first-month salary. I am getting to know the on-line trade.\n#Person1#: I'm wondering if you often trade with others on the internet.\n#Person2#: Yes, I often do business through internet now.\n#Person1#: Oh, really? Is it a good way?\n#Person2#: Yes, very gorgeous. Sometimes, I can deal with my business without stepping out of our house.\n#Person1#: What advantages does it have?\n#Person2#: Firstly, it is convenient. And secondly, it has low cost, because you know you only need to pay the fee of internet service.\n#Person1#: I agree with you. It will cost too much when going abroad to join the exhibition.\n#Person2#: The most important is that it is very convenient. You know you can browse the website and send E-mails to your customers at any time. Even you can have e-contract with your regular customers.\n#Person1#: So cool, if we do business through other ways, it will cost a lot of time.\n#Person2#: Sure, but every coin has two sides. Doing business through the internet is not as safe as doing business through traditional ways.\n#Person1#: Will you give me some suggestion?\n#Person2#: Of course, such as Alabama, which is a famous website.\n#Person1#: Thank you. Maybe I will do business through internet in the future.
#Person1#: Would you like to see our new shirts?\n#Person2#: Sorry, but I'm not really that interested in those things.\n#Person1#: Well, they are very nice you know.\n#Person2#: Really?\n#Person1#: And not expensive either.\n#Person2#: Oh, I don't care about that.\n#Person1#: Everybody is buying them.\n#Person2#: Are they?\n#Person1#: Yes, they are very fashionable, you see.\n#Person2#: I am afraid I am not interested in fashion.\n#Person1#: I see.\n#Person2#: But thank you very much all the same.\n#Person1#: Sorry I couldn't help you.
#Person1#: I called about that ad we saw in the paper.\n#Person2#: For the bank manager?\n#Person1#: That's the one.\n#Person2#: What happened?\n#Person1#: You were right, it was from a headhunter. He wouldn't tell me anything without a signed contract.\n#Person2#: Well, no surprise there.\n#Person1#: No! Not at all. But I did find out they have more than one position with different clients, so at least one would probably work out.\n#Person2#: Great, so are you going to sign a contract with them?\n#Person1#: I'm going there tomorrow.\n#Person2#: Great! Good luck.\n#Person1#: And I think I'll look in on a few other Employment Agencies while I'm downtown, to see what they have.\n#Person2#: Good idea. The more people you ask, the better your chances are.
#Person1#: Look, Jimmy's report came today.\n#Person2#: Let's have a look. What is this? Where are all the grades?\n#Person1#: He's in the third grade Sam! You see under each subject that he is being taught in school, he receives a mark from one to three. A one means his achievement or work is excellent. Here in Science for example he got a two, which means its satisfactory.\n#Person2#: What about here in physical education?\n#Person1#: He got a three here which means it's unsatisfactory. We should work on that with him.\n#Person2#: So confusing! In my day we got an A or B if we were doing well and if we failed an exam we would get an F!
#Person1#: What is your great struck?\n#Person2#: I think I'm very good at planning. I manage my time perfectly, so that I can always get things done on time.\n#Person1#: Why do you think you be a good fit or this job?\n#Person2#: Because I'm very competent in this area.\n#Person1#: Are you working under pressure?\n#Person2#: Yes, I work well under pressure and find it dimly. However, I believe planning and probable management of my time can reduce tight deadlines.\n#Person1#: Are you more a follower or a leader?\n#Person2#: I don't try to go ahead of people and lead them, I'd rather cooperate with everybody else and get the job done by working together.
#Person1#: Hi, Boss! I'd like to tell you what we've discussed during the day.\n#Person2#: Okay. Is all going well?\n#Person1#: I think it's going very well, actually. We had a long meeting with them. After several lengthy discussions they decided to accept our offer.\n#Person2#: Really? That's great. You really did a good job. Anything else to tell me?\n#Person1#: We're meeting with their finance director today and then with the other directors tomorrow, just to sort out some final details.\n#Person2#: OK. If he wants to make any changes, minor alternations can be accepted. Let me know what happens.\n#Person1#: OK. I never forget it.
#Person1#: If I understand the terms correctly, the length of the contract would be one year with a one-year option. Is that correct?\n#Person2#: Do you mean the contract for equipment rental or the one for training?\n#Person1#: I was under the impression that both contracts had the same terms.\n#Person2#: Yes and no. Let me see if I can clarify that. The terms are the same except that the contract for training has a clause that allows for the cancellation after the first six months.\n#Person1#: Could you elaborate on that?\n#Person2#: Sure. What I mean is that either side could cancel the training contract after the six months as long as it's in writing.\n#Person1#: Let me see if I have that right. This contract is for six months of training, but if it isn't cancelled, continues for another six months. Is that right?\n#Person2#: Yes, that's right.\n#Person1#: Okay, that's clear enough. Let's move on to the other terms.
#Person1#: Hello, Mr. Lawson. It's a pleasure to see you again. You seem to be in here all the time at the moment! What can I do for you today?\n#Person2#: I've prepared some L / C documents, all in accordance with the conditions. There shouldn't be any problems; I've done about a million of these things recently.\n#Person1#: You're right, no problems. You are becoming quite the expert, Mr. Lawson. If any problem does turn up, which I'm sure it won't, I'll give you a call.\n#Person2#: Thanks very much. I'm sure I'll be back, so see you again soon. Bye!
#Person1#: I really like this shirt, but I am afraid it is not my size.\n#Person2#: Try it on first. If it is the wrong size, you can try another one.\n#Person1#: Oh, where is the changing room?\n#Person2#: It's over there by the mirror.\n#Person1#: Can I take two shirts to try on now?\n#Person2#: Yes, you can take three shirts at a time to try on.\n#Person1#: I just want to try on these two that I like.\n#Person2#: OK, I'll wait here to help you when you have finished.
#Person1#: Helen,I heard you wanted to be a gym teacher, didn't you?\n#Person2#: Yes, I did think about it. But it was going to be too expensive.\n#Person1#: You mean the training?\n#Person2#: Yes. You need to pay for the use of all the equipment, you know.\n#Person1#: So you went to the nursing college.\n#Person2#: I did, and I have no regrets.\n#Person1#: Really? You enjoyed it?\n#Person2#: Oh, very much.\n#Person1#: Didn't you feel sad that you couldn't become a teacher?\n#Person2#: Well, in a way. But as time went by, I really began to like my job.
#Person1#: Hello. This is Mike. Who is it, please?\n#Person2#: Oh, Mike. This is Amy. My goodness! I've got hold of you, at last.\n#Person1#: Nice to hear from you again after all these years. What have you been doing?\n#Person2#: Well, I've tried many things since school. I'm now working for a food processing company in charge of sales. So I travel a lot.\n#Person1#: Oh, that's great. You must really enjoy it.\n#Person2#: Oh, I do. Yeah, it's interesting, but it's quite tiring. But, What about you, Mike?\n#Person1#: I work in a law firm, practicing in business law.\n#Person2#: Oh, that's challenging.\n#Person1#: Yeah, but I like my job.
#Person1#: Aaaagh!\n#Person2#: But I haven't touched you yet. What are you shouting for?\n#Person1#: You are going to touch me.\n#Person2#: Well, of course I am. How can I give you an injection without touching you. As soon as you've had the injection your gum will freeze and you won't feel a thing.\n#Person1#: How do I know what you will do while I am asleep? You might rob me.\n#Person2#: Now let's not be silly. You won't go to sleep. We don't do that nowadays. This will just freeze the area around the tooth so that you cannot feel any pain while I am pulling out the tooth. That is all. You won't go to sleep. You can watch everything in that mirror above you. Come along now.
#Person1#: It seldom rains this summer. \n#Person2#: Yeah, some places are very short of water. \n#Person1#: Because of pollution and other things, our environment has become worse and worse. \n#Person2#: You see, This time I traveled to the West. When I looked out of the windows of the rain, all the lands that I could see are as dry as a bone. \n#Person1#: It is serious. 
#Person1#: I have to find a living room set. \n#Person2#: Where are you planning on looking for one? \n#Person1#: I don't know. \n#Person2#: I can tell you where I got mine. \n#Person1#: Where did you go to find yours? \n#Person2#: IKEA has beautiful furniture. \n#Person1#: Does the furniture from IKEA cost a lot? \n#Person2#: The furniture cost a couple thousand dollars. \n#Person1#: How good of quality is the furniture? \n#Person2#: It's very sturdy. You get what you pay for. \n#Person1#: I don't mind paying for quality workmanship. \n#Person2#: I assure you that you're paying for quality. 
#Person1#: I want to find an old music box. \n#Person2#: We have a great selection. What decade are you looking for? \n#Person1#: Do you have anything made in the 1920s? \n#Person2#: We have six. \n#Person1#: Do any of them have dancing figures? \n#Person2#: Actually, two of them have dancing figures. \n#Person1#: That's fantastic. I think I like this one. \n#Person2#: A good choice. I prefer that one myself. \n#Person1#: Now, is there any warranty with this? \n#Person2#: Oh, no, I'm afraid not. These things are just too old to guarantee anything. \n#Person1#: I understand. \n#Person2#: Even if they break down, they're still works of art. 
#Person1#: I'm looking for some fresh produce that's on sale. \n#Person2#: Well, we just got in some mangoes. \n#Person1#: Mangoes. What are they? \n#Person2#: Well, it's a fruit with a big nut in it. \n#Person1#: Can you eat the nut? \n#Person2#: No, you peel off the skin and throw out the nut. \n#Person1#: How much are they? \n#Person2#: Well, the sale price is $1 each. \n#Person1#: What does a mango taste like? \n#Person2#: They're like a citrus fruit. \n#Person1#: How do I know if it's ripe? \n#Person2#: You can buy them hard. Wait a few days for them to develop a soft feel. \n#Person1#: Where do they come from? \n#Person2#: Most of them in this store are from Mexico. 
#Person1#: I would like to watch the Oscars on Tv tonight. How about you? \n#Person2#: Yes, I'd love to. It's interesting to see who is considered the best in their field and which film are thought to be particularly good. \n#Person1#: I like watching it for the fashion. I like to see what the ladies are wearing. Of course, the men nearly always just wear the traditional tuxedo. \n#Person2#: Sometimes the men wear flamboyant colours. Which films do you think will win awards this year? \n#Person1#: I'm really not sure. Usually just one or two films look set to sweep the awards ceremony, but this year there are several contenders. \n#Person2#: You're right. This year should be much more exciting than usual. What's you favourite award category? \n#Person1#: You might think this strange, but I like the category for 'best foreign language film'. \n#Person2#: It's nice to see foreign language films making a little impact on Hollywood. I like the 'best actor and actress'. 
#Person1#: Tiffany, look at the long line in front of the department store.I think they are having their annual anniversary sale again. \n#Person2#: Really? Then, how can I miss such a great opportunity to buy a cheap facial treatment? \n#Person1#: You sure? It's really crowded inside. I can hardly breathe every time I go there during the annual anniversary sale. \n#Person2#: But, everything is really on special sale. \n#Person1#: You are right. But, we had better look at the catalog and make shopping list first. I do not want to waste my time. \n#Person2#: That is a good idea. \n#Person1#: Let's walk down the stairs to the basement and take the escalator the ground floor! \n#Person2#: We can take the elevator. That is faster. \n#Person1#: You sure? According to my experience, there usually is a long line in front of the elevator. By the time you get in the elevator, all the special offer products may be sold out. \n#Person2#: Wow, you sound really professional. \n#Person1#: Well,practice makes perfect. \n#Person2#: That's true. 
#Person1#: Excuse me, I am writing an essay about ancient Greece. Are there any books on this topic that you can recommend?\n#Person2#: Geese? You want to write about ancient geese? I've never heard of such a thing. Anyway, it would be with a book of some animals, that's row J. Or you want to try science, that's in Row G.\n#Person1#: Animals? But Greece is a country, not an animal.\n#Person2#: Oh, Greece. Well, you know, today must be your lucky day. We have just received a new collection of books on that very topic. There are writers over here in row C.\n#Person1#: I see. That's a lot of books, which do you suggest?\n#Person2#: Well, the one by Robin Smith is excellent but it is very long. It's the one with the statue on the cover. There is also one by Milton Pike. It has a painting of a soldier on the front. As you can see, it's not very thick, so it shouldn't take too much time to read. But probably the best book is the one with the picture of ancient Olympic Stadium. It has won several history works rewards.\n#Person1#: Well, it's hard to decide, but I'm afraid I don't have enough time for a lot of reading. I think I'll get the book by Milton Pike.\n#Person2#: OK. Could I have your library card please?\n#Person1#: Sure, here you are.
#Person1#: Everyone seems to be on a diet, have you noticed that?\n#Person2#: Yeah, at least everyone is talking about it. A neighbor of mine is on a banana diet. She should eat one banana for breakfast, one for lunch and two for dinner.\n#Person1#: That would be bad for her teeth and her health, has she lost any weight?\n#Person2#: She doesn't look any thinner. My sister eats eggs to lose weight, only eggs for breakfast, for lunch and even for dinner.\n#Person1#: That's bad for her heart. Something in eggs is good for losing weight, but too many eggs are bad for the heart.\n#Person2#: I've read that, too. Then what about a fish diet? One of my cousins eats nothing but fish, even for breakfast.\n#Person1#: That's too expensive. The best way to lose weight is to eat less and exercise more. That's why I'm on my way to the tennis court.
#Person1#: Hi, Angela, what's up?\n#Person2#: We are planning to visit Zhang Jiakou this February. Why don't you join us?\n#Person1#: Certainly, I will if I don't have anything else on my schedule.\n#Person2#: Is the Spring Festival ok for you?\n#Person1#: Of course, which places are you going to visit?\n#Person2#: We want to visit some ski resorts in other places of interests there, you know, Zhang Jiakou is one of the whole cities for the two thousand twenty two Winter Olympic Games.\n#Person1#: In that case, we should check information online and make us a thorough plan for the trip.
#Person1#: Now, this is Westminster Abbey. It's one of the oldest buildings in London and in its architecture, you will recognize different styles.\n#Person2#: Wow, it's really splendid.\n#Person1#: There, to the left, you will see a small Street called Downing Street No.10, the last of its 10 houses has always been the living place of the British Prime Minister.\n#Person2#: Oh, is that the Tower Bridge?\n#Person1#: Yeah, look, the bridges parting in the middle and the two halves are moving upwards, a big ship is passing underneath.
#Person1#: I would like to take a trip to the beach this weekend.\n#Person2#: A trip to the beach would be fun. How is the weather going to be?\n#Person1#: The forecast says that it will be warm on the weekend.\n#Person2#: So do you think it'll be perfect weather for the beach?\n#Person1#: It sounds like it will be.\n#Person2#: I really hope it doesn't get cold.\n#Person1#: That would ruin things, I want to go so badly.\n#Person2#: The weather in California is unpredictable, so you never know.\n#Person1#: That is true. The weather is constantly changing.\n#Person2#: It would be nice if the weather would never change.\n#Person1#: That would be great, then we could plan things sooner.\n#Person2#: True. Predictable weather would make life easier.
#Person1#: I went to the tutoring service centre on campus today. And I got a job.\n#Person2#: Congratulation. What will you do?\n#Person1#: They got me a part-time tutoring job, teaching an Australian businessman Chinese.\n#Person2#: That's wonderful. I want to get a part-time job too. Tell me what I should do.\n#Person1#: It's very simple actually. You can go to the service centre and have your name and job interest resisted. They will give you a call if any job comes up.\n#Person2#: Good. I'll do it.
#Person1#: Hi, Helen! how is it going?\n#Person2#: I'm very busy these days. It seems I can never finish my work.\n#Person1#: Well, take it easy! Don't let it get on top of you.\n#Person2#: I'll try. I'm under a lot of pressure right now.\n#Person1#: Why don't you take a few days off?\n#Person2#: I can't. I am really behind of my work.
#Person1#: The bartender just gave the last call. Let's order another round, okay?\n#Person2#: Sure, but let's get a pitcher this time We should be able to down it before they close.\n#Person1#: That sounds good. You order the beer while I go to the bathroom. Where is the can in this place?\n#Person2#: It's all the way to the back. See that yellow door?\n#Person1#: Yeah. I think I can find it.\n#Person2#: You're back already. That sure was quick.\n#Person1#: That's because I just took one step inside and turned right around. That bathroom is too gross for me.\n#Person2#: Well, the bartender wouldn't give me the pitcher of beer. Anyway. He said it was too close to closing time.\n#Person1#: Let's leave then. I could take some fresh air, anyway.\n#Person2#: Okay, let's go!
#Person1#: I am afraid that I spoke wrong in front of all of the tables. Such a big mistake.\n#Person2#: Never mind about that.\n#Person1#: I am terribly sorry. Will you forgive me?\n#Person2#: No, It's totally okay. Don't blame yourself.
#Person1#: We're going to need a lot of new stuff after the holidays. Let's make a list.\n#Person2#: Fine, Mr. Richardson. What do you have in mind?\n#Person1#: Well, to begin with, we're going to have to get a new desk for you and I'd like to replace that old typewriter.\n#Person2#: Yes! I agree! We could really use another one! I'll get on that right away! What else would you like to order?
#Person1#: Do you know a bus that I can take from Altadena to downtown LA?\n#Person2#: I believe you can take the 486.\n#Person1#: Will that bus really take me to LA?\n#Person2#: It sure will.\n#Person1#: Is it a very long ride?\n#Person2#: It's a forty-five minute to an hour ride.\n#Person1#: Really?\n#Person2#: It doesn't take long at all\n#Person1#: Do a lot of people ride that bus?\n#Person2#: More people start getting on around LA.\n#Person1#: Wow, thanks a lot.\n#Person2#: Don't mention it.
#Person1#: How do you shoot pool?\n#Person2#: You have 16 balls on the table, 7 solid colored, 7 striped colored, a black 8 ball, and the white ball.\n#Person1#: And?\n#Person2#: You hit the white ball with your cue. The white ball hits the colored balls. And you want to get the colored balls into the pockets.\n#Person1#: How do you know whether you should hit the solid or the striped one?\n#Person2#: At the beginning, it does not matter, but once someone gets one ball in, it is set.\n#Person1#: Can I get the black ball in?\n#Person2#: The black ball has to be the final ball in the pockets.\n#Person1#: Let's go and try now!
#Person1#: When will our party be held?\n#Person2#: Next Wednesday.\n#Person1#: Have you sent out invitations to the house warming party to all the people I have listed on this paper?\n#Person2#: Yes, I have.\n#Person1#: When did you send them?\n#Person2#: Ten days ago.\n#Person1#: Okay, that's good. Could Dr. Cole like to attend the party?\n#Person2#: Yes, he will.\n#Person1#: That's fine.
#Person1#: Hey Steven! You have a large chunk of money, but why do you still live in the old flat, instead of buying a new villa?\n#Person2#: I like to live here and enjoy my neighbors'company. And I don't think I should waste money just because I have much of it.\n#Person1#: But I found you always hate to part with your money. Look at the car you drive! You must have droven it for at least twenty years! It's such a junker!\n#Person2#: Oh, the car is old but still in good condition. I just think we should be thrifty, whether you are rich or not.\n#Person1#: But. . . But. . .\n#Person2#: But what? Just remember that thrift is not only a great virtue, but also a great revenue.\n#Person1#: I am sorry. Maybe you are right.
#Person1#: Look, there are some words on the fish.\n#Person2#: I know that they are auspicious fish. It's quite popular nowadays.\n#Person1#: For God's sake! It's too bloody. How can people be so cruel?\n#Person2#: Not at all. I think the tattoos are so cool and chic.\n#Person1#: You can't prick the fish to please the sick tastes of some bloody people.\n#Person2#: Honey, it's not so serious. It's just an animal.\n#Person1#: Just an animal? But it has life too. If you want a tattoo, get one. It's your choice because you want it. But has anyone asked the fish if it wanted one?\n#Person2#: OK, I understand, but what else could we do?
#Person1#: Hi. are you new here?\n#Person2#: Yes. I moved here last week.\n#Person1#: I'm Steven, your neighbour.\n#Person2#: I'm Charlie. Nice to meet you.\n#Person1#: Nice to meet you, too.\n#Person2#: Since we live in the same neighbourhood, maybe we can help each other from now on.\n#Person1#: I guess so. I live next door but one, and hope you'll drop in now and then.\n#Person2#: Thank you. I will.
#Person1#: What is wrong with Peter? He sure looks unhappy.\n#Person2#: His girlfriend dumped him, and he is tearing his heart out over her.\n#Person1#: How foolish he is. The girl is inviting. She often makes a pass at boys.\n#Person2#: Love is blind, you know.
#Person1#: Sometimes I think television is too biased. None of them are completely objective.\n#Person2#: That's unavoidable, but think, How would you keep up to date without television?\n#Person1#: Newspapers or the radio I guess. I just wish TV was more objective.\n#Person2#: Look, you can still learn a lot from watching television, you just need to be smart when you're watching. Filter the information and decide if you believe what you are hearing or not.\n#Person1#: The internet's a lot worse.\n#Person2#: Really? Why?\n#Person1#: There's no one moderating it. Anyone around the world can put information onto the net for anyone else to see. The information on the internet is mostly unsubstantiated and you can never know who has written it, or why. A lot of people get conned online.\n#Person2#: Again, you need to think carefully. If you don't trust others online, have nothing to do with them.
#Person1#: Didn't you say you were planning a trip to China? I heard the northwest and north of China are experiencing severe sandstorms!\n#Person2#: I was planning to go to Beijing first and then go to northwest China! Looks like I'm in trouble.\n#Person1#: Definitely. I heard Beijing was experiencing seven degree strong winds! That is nearly a record high!\n#Person2#: No way! I don't think I've ever encountered winds that strong! Are the storms affecting land and air transportation?\n#Person1#: Absolutely! I don't think any planes are going anywhere. The sand being blown around has cut visibility in Beijing to less than 100 meters. But inseems Gansu Province is being hit the hardest.\n#Person2#: That's exactly where I was planning to go!\n#Person1#: Well, this storm originated in the plateaus in northwest China. At the moment, that area is calmer.
#Person1#: Have you seen the new Hannibal Lecter movie?\n#Person2#: Oh, yes. You?\n#Person1#: Yes. What did you think of it?\n#Person2#: I thought it was better than the others. I really liked it. What did you think of it?\n#Person1#: I liked it, too. It was scary, but not disgusting. I always enjoy watching Anthony Hopkins. He's brilliant.\n#Person2#: Mmm. That's what I thought, too. And I always enjoy watching Anthony Hopkins.\n#Person1#: Oh, yes, he is brilliant. What's the name of the young actor?\n#Person2#: Hum, Edward Norton, or something like that.\n#Person1#: Yes. He was excellent. They worked well together.
#Person1#: Yeah. You don't need to rub it in.\n#Person2#: And then she made the deal with MicroPower. Vince wanted to sell for fifteen million. . .\n#Person1#: Fifteen? And Zina pushed them up to seventy-five?\n#Person2#: That's right. Vince still stops by her office every day to thank her.\n#Person1#: Anyway, I'm still happy I left. I'm working as a freelancer now.\n#Person2#: You really should have stayed with us, Dave.
#Person1#: what date is it today?\n#Person2#: why?\n#Person1#: look at the girls in the street. They all have bunch of flowers. Is it Valentine's Day?\n#Person2#: Oh, yes! I completely forgot about it.\n#Person1#: did you have a fight with Jack?\n#Person2#: no, but now he'll be in trouble. What's a boyfriend for? To forget about Valentine's Day?\n#Person1#: come on, dear! You forgot it, too.\n#Person2#: you know, it's OK for a girl to forget these ' big days ', but for a guy, to do that is unforgivable.\n#Person1#: is that your phone?\n#Person2#: oh, it's Jack. Excuse me.\n#Person1#: wow! good timing.\n#Person2#: he asked me out to a dinner tonight. How about joining us?\n#Person1#: come on! three's a crowd!\n#Person2#: so what?\n#Person1#: just go! it's Valentine's Day!
#Person1#: I need help preparing for my presentation on Friday.\n#Person2#: I could help you with that.\n#Person1#: Are you sure you have the time?\n#Person2#: I promise you that I have the time to do this. If I didn't, I wouldn't offer to help.\n#Person1#: What would be the best time for you to help me?\n#Person2#: Tomorrow night would work for me.\n#Person1#: Should we just meet here?\n#Person2#: OK, and I'll bring some information that helped me with my presentation.\n#Person1#: I'll see you then.\n#Person2#: See you tomorrow night.
#Person1#: I went to Roth's to interview her, you know, Edith Roth is the author of a book about moths.\n#Person2#: Is she? I thought she was a mathematician.\n#Person1#: I'm so thirsty.\n#Person2#: Are you? I thought you had something to drink at her home.\n#Person1#: No. Edith didn't give anything to drink.\n#Person2#: I'll buy you a drink.\n#Person1#: Oh! Thank you.
#Person1#: Excuse me, are cameras allowed here?\n#Person2#: Sorry, sir, in order to protect these paintings, taking photos are strictly forbidden here.\n#Person1#: I see. What a pity. I have to appreciate it carefully.\n#Person2#: I am really sorry for that.
#Person1#: Now please tell me something about your past work achievements.\n#Person2#: All right, madam. When I was sales manager at the Beijing Friendship Store. I succeeded in raising the yearly sales volume by 25 percent and profit margins from 50 percent to 80 percent.\n#Person1#: That is quite an achievement! Do you consider it your most rewarding work experience?\n#Person2#: I don't think so. I'll create further achievement in the future.\n#Person1#: Have you received any honors?\n#Person2#: Yes. I got the title of Advance Worker in 2006.\n#Person1#: Do you have any publications?\n#Person2#: Yes. I wrote a thesis entitled On Interpersonal Relations in the Socialist Market Economy and it was published in China Daily.
#Person1#: Good afternoon. Can I help you?\n#Person2#: Is it possible for me to buy some RMB at this counter?\n#Person1#: Of course, that's no problem at all.\n#Person2#: That's a relief! I was a little worried about it ; I left England in a bit of a hurry.\n#Person1#: How much would you like to change?\n#Person2#: Well, I'm only here for 3 days, so I think 500 GAP should be plenty.\n#Person1#: Please fill in this exchange form, and I'll need to see your passport, and sign here. That's the money and your passport back. Of course, if you don't spend all of it, you can come back and we'd be happy to buy the local currency back from you.
#Person1#: What seems to be the problem?\n#Person2#: Your secretary seems to think she is being harassed.\n#Person1#: What? You've got to be kidding me!\n#Person2#: I wish I were, but i am deadly serious. She said you invited her to dinner last week.\n#Person1#: Of course I did. As recognition for a job well done. Once a month I invite the most productive employee to dinner.\n#Person2#: Well, there is no problem there. But she seemed to think that you were angry when she refused, and that your motives are personal and not professional.\n#Person1#: I think she's misinterpreted my intentions. What happens now?\n#Person2#: Our harassment policy requires that we have a meeting with the HR manager and Miss Brown. It's quite serious. You could be reprimanded, or even fired if we find evidence that you were pressuring\n#Person1#: I understand that. But I hope that we can get to the bottom fo this and show Miss Brown that she misunderstood my reaction.\n#Person2#: That's the purpose of the meeting. Sometimes a mediated conversation will straighten things out, and a little discussion and apology can calm the waters.
#Person1#: Can you tell me about some good deals on produce?\n#Person2#: The mangoes are on sale today.\n#Person1#: What exactly are mangoes?\n#Person2#: They have yellowish red skin. It's a fruit with one big seed.\n#Person1#: Is the seed edible?\n#Person2#: Maybe if you were a parrot. I wouldn't recommend it.\n#Person1#: How much does a mango cost?\n#Person2#: Normally, they're $ 2 each. Today, they're only $ 1 each.\n#Person1#: Maybe I won't like the taste.\n#Person2#: It's hard to describe. They're sweet, but also sort of citrusy.\n#Person1#: How do I tell the difference between a ripe one and an unripe one?\n#Person2#: They're similar to an avocado. When the outside feels soft, they're ripe.\n#Person1#: Where do most of them come from?\n#Person2#: These are from Mexico.
#Person1#: I'm calling to ask about your apartment advertised.\n#Person2#: Yes, we've got great apartments with charming environment and nice scenery. And they are all newly renovated.\n#Person1#: That sounds fantastic! But I am looking for something closer to the downtown, as I spend most of my time at the office.\n#Person2#: No problem. We have a nice apartment located near the Oriental Square. It's perfect for people busy with office work. It is fully furnished with a service staff taking care of the trivial details.\n#Person1#: I'm sure it is wonderful, but I need an unfurnished apartment with relatively lower cost.\n#Person2#: Ah! I get your point. We have just what you need. Our Jinyuan apartments have several floor plans. The one bedroom apartments are very economical, but their layout makes great use of a small amount of space. I think you can find the right apartment there.\n#Person1#: Great!

You can phone me again if you cann't find the right place.\n#Person1#: Ok. Thank you.
#Person1#: Happy Birthday, Mary!\n#Person2#: Thank you.\n#Person1#: Here is a gift for you. I hope you like it.\n#Person2#: What a lovely dog! How did you know I love this?\n#Person1#: I had my own ways of finding out. It's a secret. You look so beautiful today. Your new shirt goes well with your skirt.\n#Person2#: Maybe you don't believe it, but it was made by my grandmother.\n#Person1#: Really? It looks so nice.\n#Person2#: Thank you. Please have a cup of tea.\n#Person1#: All right.\n#Person2#: How about some fish?\n#Person1#: No, thanks. I've had enough. Now, Mary, before you blow out the birthday candles, you have to make a wish. After that, you may cut the cake.\n#Person2#: OK, let me make a wish. . . Do you want a big piece of cake?\n#Person1#: No, just a small one. Next let's sing'Happy Birthday'to Mary.\n#Person2#: It is very kind of you. I'm so moved by you.
#Person1#: Would you like to come by and play bridge?\n#Person2#: Well, let's see. Why don't we go dancing for a change? We haven't done that for a long time.\n#Person1#: Well, to tell the truth, I don't really feel like it tonight. I had a pretty hard day and I'm sort of tired.\n#Person2#: Hmm. Well, in that case, we could go to the movies.\n#Person1#: Oh, we always go to the movies. Can't we do something different?\n#Person2#: Well, do you have any suggestions?\n#Person1#: Let's see. How do you feel about playing bridge?\n#Person2#: It's OK with me, but we don't have any beer and things.\n#Person1#: Well, shall I call Janet and ask her and Tom to come over, and I'll go to the store and buy some stuff.\n#Person2#: OK.
#Person1#: Let's get down to business.\n#Person2#: OK. Have you seen the samples?\n#Person1#: Yes. I have. I'm interested in your underwear. If the price is acceptable we would like to order it soon.\n#Person2#: I'm glad to hear that. We are trying to give you a favourable one.\n#Person1#: What's your price?\n#Person2#: 150 yuan for each piece.\n#Person1#: That's a bit more than I was prepared to pay.\n#Person2#: How about 130 yuan?\n#Person1#: I offer you 110 yuan.\n#Person2#: That's too little. Well, I'll come down to 120 yuan.\n#Person1#: All right. I go up to 115 yuan, but not a penny more. Is that acceptable?\n#Person2#: If you order more than 10, 000 pieces, we can accept 115 yuan for each one.\n#Person1#: Well, I'll accept the price and place an order for 10, 000 pieces.\n#Person2#: Very good. It's a pleasure to do business with you, Mrs. Phoebe.
#Person1#: Did you already wash your clothes today?\n#Person2#: I've only washed my white clothes.\n#Person1#: Could you wash some of my dark clothes with yours?\n#Person2#: Is there any special care I should take with your clothes?\n#Person1#: The only thing is that they have to be washed on the gentle cycle.\n#Person2#: Are there a lot of clothes?\n#Person1#: There aren't a lot of clothes, do you have a lot to wash?\n#Person2#: It's a medium load.\n#Person1#: You don't mind, do you?\n#Person2#: No big deal. I'll do it for you.\n#Person1#: Okay, thanks a lot.\n#Person2#: You're welcome.
#Person1#: Berry, you're just back from Rio de Janeiro?\n#Person2#: Yeah.\n#Person1#: What was it like?\n#Person2#: Well, the first day in Rio was quite a shock for us. Here it was a lot of fat middle-aged Europeans and Americans exercising along the beach, sunbathing, walking with their walkmans. It's a big contrast to the thousands of people sleeping on the street during night.\n#Person1#: What was the weather like?\n#Person2#: The climate is very different from other places such as Peru or Bolivia. We were at sea level, and we all felt very good about it. No one of us needed to breathe extra air from time to time, and the temperature is about 25 degrees and the air is very humid.\n#Person1#: That's really nice.\n#Person2#: The first day we had very nice weather, and were able to really relax on the beach. After these two days we had bad weather, rain and cloudy. So, we're a little bit disappointed about that. Due to the weather, we explored the old part of Rio.\n#Person1#: How about the food there?\n#Person2#: We ate at local restaurant. Tiffs restaurant has a fixed fee of about US $10. Then you can eat as much as you want from a vast and delicate buffet consisting of both seafood and meat. Dessert and drinks are not included.\n#Person1#: It's been really a nice trip.\n#Person2#: Well, Rio was not the experience we had hoped for, and we feel that this city is over-publicized. But anyway it's cool to have been there.
#Person1#: Hello. I need a room for two days from June 3 to 4. Do you have any spare room?\n#Person2#: Sorry, sir. We are fully booked on that day. But we do have rooms on June 5 and 6.\n#Person1#: OK. I book a single room for the two days.
#Person1#: Hi, Ann. I hear you've started evening discussions on popular music. How is it going?\n#Person2#: Pretty well. I must say I've learned a lot. But it would be nicer to have someone who knows more about the subject. Could you possibly join us?\n#Person1#: Certainly. When do you usually meet?\n#Person2#: We meet twice a week-Tuesday and Saturday. Is the time convenient for you?\n#Person1#: Tuesday is OK. But I don't think I can come on Saturday.\n#Person2#: What about Friday evenings? We hope to see you present.\n#Person1#: OK. I'm free on Friday evenings.
#Person1#: Why don't you get another job for a change?\n#Person2#: But I like my job.\n#Person1#: Look, digging gardens is not a job for a university graduate.\n#Person2#: But the money's not bad and there's plenty of fresh air.\n#Person1#: If I were you, I'd take some kind of direction, like teaching law.\n#Person2#: Teaching? Anything but that. It's so boring.\n#Person1#: Come on, you really must think of the future.\n#Person2#: I'll tell you what. I'd like to be a doctor.\n#Person1#: Well, you should think very seriously about that. It means a lot of study, and then working all sorts of hours.\n#Person2#: Yes, maybe. But the idea sounds interesting.\n#Person1#: Well, then, you ought to get more information about it as soon as possible.
#Person1#: Good morning, sir. This way, please. \n#Person2#: Thank you. It's nice here. \n#Person1#: I'm so glad you like it. What would you like? We serve tea, milk and coffee, cakes and cold drinks. Please look at the menu for morning drinks. \n#Person2#: I'll try a cup of tea without sugar. How about you, Emma? \n#Person3#: I'd like to have coffee with lemon and custard pudding. \n#Person1#: Anything else? We've the sirloin steak today, I suggest that you try them. \n#Person2#: All right, Let's try them. 
#Person1#: Would you please teach me how to use the computer? \n#Person2#: Sure, let's take a look at the menu first. \n#Person1#: Do I have to turn on the computer? \n#Person2#: yes, we can look at the computer and computer menu at the same time. And this will help us undstand both better. \n#Person1#: What should I learn first? \n#Person2#: Right now I'll teach you to open files, save files and copy files. Are you ready? \n#Person1#: I am ready I am going to get, let's start! 
#Person1#: Nice to see you; how have you been feeling lately? \n#Person2#: I have been feeling great, Dr. Smith. \n#Person1#: I am happy that you have decided to come in for your annual physical. \n#Person2#: Yes, I am going on a cross-country bike ride on vacation and want to make sure that I don't have any problems. \n#Person1#: We are going to look at your heart and lungs, do a few blood tests, and see that your eyes, ears, and nose are all working as they should. \n#Person2#: I've been having trouble with congestion in my chest. Can you give me some tests for that? \n#Person1#: I can do a chest X-ray to check for congestion. \n#Person2#: That would be great. What is the blood test for? \n#Person1#: The blood test is for cholesterol, white blood cell count, and blood sugar. \n#Person2#: I have been feeling great. I don't imagine that any of my tests will turn out badly. 
#Person1#: They are professors and government officials. \n#Person2#: Where are they from? \n#Person1#: Most of them are from America and Europe. \n#Person2#: What are they doing in Beijing? \n#Person1#: They are attending an international conference here. \n#Person2#: Which hotel are they staying at? \n#Person1#: They are staying at the Hilton Hotel. 
#Person1#: What do you plan to do on Sunday morning? \n#Person2#: Nothing special. \n#Person1#: How about going to English corner with me? \n#Person2#: Oh, I'd rather not. \n#Person1#: Why not ? \n#Person2#: You know, I am poor at English, especially spoken English. \n#Person1#: That's why you should go there, If you don't dare to speak English owing to the fact that you are afraid of making mistakes, you simply will never learn English. 
#Person1#: I hear you are planning to travel abroad.\n#Person2#: Yes, I'm going to the United States. Where do you think I should go?\n#Person1#: In my opinion, there are several places you mustn't miss, like Washington DC, Las Vegas, New York and Los Angeles.\n#Person2#: Someone has suggested that we go to Hawaii.\n#Person1#: Yes, you should consider Hawaii too. It's definitely worth a visit. There are some beautiful beaches there.\n#Person2#: I would definitely enjoy some beautiful sunshine.\n#Person1#: That's right. I've been there twice with my parents and they both agree it is really a wonderful place.\n#Person2#: OK. I'll talk about it with my wife and I believe she'll love the idea of visiting Hawaii.\n#Person1#: I hope you enjoy your trip.
#Person1#: I'll have a get together with my friends tomorrow. Could you tell me what to wear Lucy?\n#Person2#: How about this red T-shirt Mark? It can make you look active.\n#Person1#: Oh, red makes me tense. I'd rather wear the yellow T-shirt.\n#Person2#: The yellow one? Why?\n#Person1#: Because it makes me feel relaxed and look confident.\n#Person2#: Ok, perhaps you should wear a black hat and blue jeans.\n#Person1#: You mean a yellow T-shirt with a black hat and blue jeans? That's a good choice.\n#Person2#: Yeah, you must be a star at the party.
#Person1#: Kathy, it seems you're having a lot of fun playing tennis.\n#Person2#: Would you like to learn?\n#Person1#: Yes, how do you play?\n#Person2#: Tennis can be played in singles or doubles. Look, there, the outside lines are for doubles and the inside lines are for singles.\n#Person1#: How do you decide who start serving?\n#Person2#: Well, you can use a coin to decide. Whoever wins chooses either to serve or the side of the court.\n#Person1#: How do you count the score?\n#Person2#: At the beginning, the score would be love.\n#Person1#: Love means 0?\n#Person2#: You got it, it is then counted to 15, 30 and 40. If you get to 40 and win again, you win the game.\n#Person1#: The other side start serving then?\n#Person2#: Right, see? You know how to play now.
#Person1#: I'd like to speak to Mister Johnson, please.\n#Person2#: Speaking.\n#Person1#: Oh hello. This is Erica Stone. My living room window was broken this afternoon. Can you repair it?\n#Person2#: Sure, I can come over tomorrow afternoon. Is that OK?\n#Person1#: Could you come over now?\n#Person2#: OK. I'll come over and take a look in a little while.\n#Person1#: You charge about $100, don't you?\n#Person2#: Usually if it's a small window. See, didn't I repair a window for you a few weeks ago?\n#Person1#: Yes, you did.\n#Person2#: Oh, and your little ones have broken the window again. Were they playing ball in the house?\n#Person1#: Well, no. I told them not to do that anymore. This time I broke it. I was practicing volleyball.\n#Person2#: Oh, you did, did you?
#Person1#: Hi, professor Smith.\n#Person2#: Hi, Justine, how are you?\n#Person1#: I am OK, but I'm doing badly in your class. I am wondering how to do better.\n#Person2#: I think comeing prepared class may do something to improve your grades.\n#Person1#: How can I prepare for class?\n#Person2#: Have you checked out my web page? All of my lecture notes are on my web page. You can download the notes and read them ahead of time.\n#Person1#: Really? Wow, that would be very helpful.\n#Person2#: Another good idea is to read each chapter in the book before class.\n#Person1#: I usually don't read the chapter ahead of time. I thought hearing the lecture first was better than reading first.\n#Person2#: Reading first is actually better. You should also write down ideas or notes while you're reading. That way, you can come to class with some questions.
#Person1#: Cindy, the date of the computer meeting has been set for next Tuesday. Could you do me a favor and call the hotel to book a room?\n#Person2#: Sure, I will take care of it right away. But what are you going to do about the appointment you had planned with Mr. Nolan? Do you want me to call him and cancel?\n#Person1#: Oh, I completely forgot all about him. You know, I can't miss this appointment with him. It's too important. On second thought, I think I'd better send Sally to New York to attend the meeting. She's been working on the speech with me for a long time, and she should be able to give the speech in my place.\n#Person2#: You're right.
#Person1#: Jenny, thank you for your help with my paper.\n#Person2#: It's my pleasure if I have done something helpful to you.\n#Person1#: I am really grateful for the reference books you offered me. But for the materials, I would not have written my paper so quickly.\n#Person2#: It's nice of you to say so. I am interested in your paper and I happen to have some books on the topic.\n#Person1#: Your books are important to me. Besides, you have given me some very good suggestions. I really thank you so much.\n#Person2#: You are welcome.
#Person1#: Hello, Viola. I see that you take this book with you all day. What book is it?\n#Person2#: A wrinkle in time.\n#Person1#: You had a birthday party last weekend. So is this book a birthday gift from your friends or classmates?\n#Person2#: It is a birthday gift. My uncle sent it to me from New York.\n#Person1#: It must be a fantastic book, right?\n#Person2#: Yeah, in the book, together with her brother Charles and her friend Calvin, Meg starts the journey to find her missing father, who is a scientist.\n#Person1#: Sounds interesting.

#Person1#: How was your trip, Dan? I'd love to go round the world.\n#Person2#: It was great. First we went to London but only for a few days as it rained all the time. Both of us got really wet.\n#Person1#: You went to Paris next, didn't you?\n#Person2#: Well, Paris wasn't at all, sunny, but it was better than London, a bit cloudy.\n#Person1#: Did you go up the Eiffel Tower?\n#Person2#: Yes. We both had a great time.\n#Person1#: Where did you go after Paris?\n#Person2#: To Sydney. We didn't get to the famous Bondi Beach as there were a lot of thunderstorms. We did some shopping there.\n#Person1#: I bet that was expensive.\n#Person2#: It wasn't as expensive as Tokyo. It was hot and sunny there, no rain at all for the whole 5 days we were there.\n#Person1#: And then you went to the USA, didn't you?\n#Person2#: Yes, to San Francisco, which is famous for its fog. It was so thick that we didn't go to see the Golden Gate Bridge. But it was warmer than some of the other places.
#Person1#: I see there are some workmen on the site. When is the building work due to start?\n#Person2#: Well, it'll take three weeks to demolish the old building and clear away the debris. We should be ready to start the construction work in week 23.\n#Person1#: How long will the sub contractors be on site?\n#Person2#: About ten weeks in total if everything goes according to plan.\n#Person1#: I'm sure it will. So, we should be able to start moving the machinery in during week 34. I'll confirm that date with our suppliers.

#Person1#: Tony, could you tell me if there are any special rules about the job?\n#Person2#: Working hours are from 8: 30 a. m. to 5:00 p. m. Be sure not to be late or absent. Report to the manager by filling in the ' Monthly Report ' every month.\n#Person1#: Is there anything else? How about my salary?\n#Person2#: Our company has a strict and reasonable salary standard. On the 20th day of every month, you can get your salary on time. Benefits depend upon the length of service and the employee's past attendance record.\n#Person1#: Wow, thank you for telling me these. Do you mind telling me something else, like attendance record, holiday, and how to ask for leave?\n#Person2#: All new members are likely to ask the same questions. Haha. I can understand that. Every month you have three days off, besides the weekends and some important holidays. After you've been here for a year, you qualify for a one-week vacation. The leave less than a half-day should predict for an hour, and more than a half-day should predict three days.\n#Person1#: Okay, that's good. I get it.

I ' ll take it.

I travel a lot every year on business, but this is my first visit to your country. I must say I have been much impressed by your friendly people.\n#Person2#: Thank you for saying so. Have you seen the exhibition halls? On display are most of our products, such as silk, woolen knitwear, cotton piece goods, and garments.\n#Person1#: Oh, yes. I had a look yesterday. I found some of the exhibits to be fine in quality and beautiful in design. The exhibition has successfully displayed to me what your corporation handles.

They have met with great favor overseas and are always in great demand.

The first thing you should do is put your seat belt on.\n#Person2#: you should also put yours on. you never know what will happen with me in the driver's seat!\n#Person1#: very funny. Next you should check your side mirrors and your rear view mirror. Can you see out of them?\n#Person2#: I can't see anything out of the side mirror on your side of the car. Could you move it forward a bit, please?\n#Person1#: how's that?\n#Person2#: that's better. Now what?\n#Person1#: check your petrol situation.\n#Person2#: the tank is almost empty. I guess I'll drive to the petrol station to fill it up.\n#Person1#: that's a good idea. Put your keys in the ignition, start it up, put the car in reserve, wait for the road to be clear, and then back out of the driveway.\n#Person2#: I got it. Don't worry. I'll get you there in one piece.\n#Person1#: remember, no honking this time. The horn is only for emergencies!\n#Person2#: why does that cop car behind me have its red lights on?
#Person1#: This small town has many serious problems.\n#Person2#: What's the cause?\n#Person1#: The mayor and high officials practice cronyism and a large number of guys who are good at nothing occupy many important positions.\n#Person2#: I see why it lags behind other towns.
#Person1#: Hello there! Come on in! Don't just stand there! Come and take a seat!\n#Person2#: Um, okay. Well, I just want a trim. Nothing too fancy.\n#Person1#: Oh my gosh! Your hair is amazing! So silky, so shiny! I am going to work my magic on your hair! You hear me? You are going to look like a million bucks!\n#Person2#: Okay.

I just love your curly hair! It's so fluffy and cute! You should totally let it grow out. An afro would look great on you!\n#Person2#: Um. . . no.\n#Person1#: Okay, but you are going to be my masterpiece!
#Person1#: This apartment is great, but could I upgrade a few things?\n#Person2#: What are you unhappy with?\n#Person1#: I want to have a different color carpet.\n#Person2#: If you agree to pay more money, you could upgrade the carpet.\n#Person1#: Would it cost a lot more?\n#Person2#: It could be as little as 2 dollars or as much as 10 dollars more per square yard.\n#Person1#: I was also wondering if it would be possible to pick a different paint color.\n#Person2#: Bring me a paint sample to look at, and I will consider it.\n#Person1#: When can you finish with the new carpet and paint?\n#Person2#: Your new apartment can be recarpeted and repainted by next Tuesday.
#Person1#: What would you say if I told you I was going to quit school?\n#Person2#: I'd say, think twice about it. Well, you are not going to quit school, are you?\n#Person1#: I don't know. I failed my exam.\n#Person2#: What did you get?\n#Person1#: A B plus.\n#Person2#: That's not bad.\n#Person1#: But I should have aced it. I mean I finished the paper so quickly, thinking it's a piece of cake. But when I knew my result, I was like what? That can't be true!\n#Person2#: Listen, John. I understand that you are such an excellent student and I know you must have lots of stress, but you really want to give up?\n#Person1#: No, I don't. I just don't know how to handle this. This is my first time, you know.\n#Person2#: I know. Don't worry. Do you know what you should do?\n#Person1#: What?\n#Person2#: You need to blow off some steam. The world is not on your shoulder.\n#Person1#: How?\n#Person2#: Forget about school and exams. Come over to my house and have fun. I have some really good DVDs.\n#Person1#: Thanks.

#Person1#: Professor, could I make an appointment with you?\n#Person2#: I am free tomorrow afternoon between two and four ; do you have a particular time in mind?\n#Person1#: Two o'clock would be the best time.\n#Person2#: Fine, do you know where my office is?\n#Person1#: No, I'm not sure.\n#Person2#: Remember, it is in the E building on the third floor.\n#Person1#: I see.\n#Person2#: Don't worry, it will work out fine once you get there. I'll see you then.\n#Person1#: I'll see you then.\n#Person2#: Looking forward to meeting with you!
#Person1#: Excuse me. But are you Mrs. Smith from America?\n#Person2#: That's it. I am Maria Smith. You must be Zhang Lin from Tianjin Sports Facility Co. Ltd.\n#Person1#: Yes. Nice to meet you, Mrs. Smith.\n#Person2#: Nice to meet you too, Mr. Zhang.
#Person1#: We've got a problem. . . it looks like we'll need more spotlights on the exhibition booth. The client thinks it's too dark, and they want to add halogen lighting. We've already got 3 sets of track lighting from you guys, do you think you could help us out and throw in some halogens?\n#Person2#: Oh. . . Um. . . I don't think so. you know the halogen lighting is much more expensive than your track lighting system. Plus I'm going to have to call in some guys to install it for you. That's not going to come cheap.\n#Person1#: But it would only be adding to the existing structure. We're not talking about anything new here. . .\n#Person2#: It doesn't matter because we will still have to call the electrician out, and they are union labor. It'll cost you a pretty penny. . .\n#Person1#: How much do you think it would cost?\n#Person2#: Mumm, I estimate it'll run in the neighborhood of. . . $ 500 per light.\n#Person1#: $ 500per light? ! That's ridiculous! It can't possibly be that expansive!\n#Person2#: It is, I'll tell you why. We'll have to call in the electrician, he's going to charge overtime now because it's already 5PM, and it will probably take him an hour a light. Plus, the halogen lights take more electricity, so your electrical cost is going to be higher as well.\n#Person1#: Can't you give me a break on this? We've already spent so much money on lighting, I hate to have to blow so much more on halogens.\n#Person2#: No, that's the cost, and that's what it's going to cost us. We can't go in the hole with this. I am giving you my best price, so take it, or leave it.
#Person1#: So how was your interview?\n#Person2#: I haven't gone to the interview yet. It's tomorrow. I am so nervous.\n#Person1#: Don't worry. You should do fine. You have the experience.\n#Person2#: I hope so.\n#Person1#: Remember, they want someone who works well with people. You've got to show them how easy-going and personable you are.\n#Person2#: Thanks, I'll keep that in mind.
#Person1#: I need help in ordering my office supplies.\n#Person2#: You can print out a copy of the Order Supply Form from our company web site and turn in into me. What will you be needing?\n#Person1#: I need ink cartridges, staples, and Post-its.\n#Person2#: Will you need all of them right away or can some wait?\n#Person1#: Some of these can wait but there are a few things that I need right away.\n#Person2#: You can only buy supplies that you have a budget for. Do you know what your budget is?\n#Person1#: We have plenty of money for office supplies.\n#Person2#: You can pick these supplies up or they can be delivered to your building. Which would you prefer?\n#Person1#: I want to pick them up.\n#Person2#: Well, just finish the request and we will contact you when the supplies come in. Have a good day!\n#Person1#: You too!
#Person1#: Good afternoon, Mr. Yang. I'm Jill, Mr. Smith's secretary. Would you like to look around the factory first?\n#Person2#: Yes, I would.\n#Person1#: Now this is our office block. We have all the administrative departments Sales, Accounting, Personnel, Market Research and so on.\n#Person2#: What's that building opposite us?\n#Person1#: That's the warehouse where the larger items of medical instruments are stored. We keep a stock of the fast-moving items so that urgent orders can be met quickly from stock. ( in the workshop ) This is one of our three workshops. This is the delivery bay here.\n#Person2#: Oh, I see.\n#Person1#: The steel sheets and bars come in, as you see, in different sizes and are unloaded onto the delivery bay here. We buy them in from a steel works in Wales. This is the new conveyor belt we installed last year. We doubled our output in this department as a result.\n#Person2#: Oh, really?\n#Person1#: I'll take you to the assembly shop. . .
#Person1#: Gosh, another stop. It seems the cars ahead of us have to stop every two minutes, It's no quicker than a bus.\n#Person2#: That's true. During rush hours, taxis are just as quick as buses.\n#Person1#: It was silly of me to have taken a taxi.\n#Person2#: At least, it can free you from the crowd. By the way, do you come from China?\n#Person1#: No, from New Zealand, sir. I visited New Zealand and saw lots of overseas people there.\n#Person2#: Wow, like America. It receives a great number of visitors every year.\n#Person1#: The more the world becomes open, the more people become international!
#Person1#: I can't stand the stupid guy any longer. It's unbelievable.\n#Person2#: Oh, my dear lady, take it easy. You should forgive a green hand like him.\n#Person1#: He does everything so mindlessly that he is going to drive me crazy.\n#Person2#: I suggest you talk with him and teach him how to deal with the problems.\n#Person1#: I've told him how to do that several times, but he's never listened to me.\n#Person2#: Maybe you should communicate with him just like a friend, not a boss.\n#Person1#: Oh, I always have difficulty in getting along with the staff.\n#Person2#: Just take them for your good friends and have a talk with them as we do. Make sure you won't lose your temper!\n#Person1#: Oh, so bad. I'm afraid I'll change the image of myself.\n#Person2#: No, it's unnecessary. Just respect the staff and their own opinions.\n#Person1#: But sometimes they offer some useless proposals, it's awfully useless.\n#Person2#: Oh, no one is perfect.\n#Person1#: That's right. I should speak to them in a polite way.\n#Person2#: We have the equal partnership in team.\n#Person1#: Thanks very much and you're very eloquent.\n#Person2#: Thanks for saying that.
#Person1#: Hey Ted, I saw this ad in the paper. You should take a look.\n#Person2#: What is it?\n#Person1#: It's for a job. It looks perfect for you.\n#Person2#: Let's see. . .

I'll call now to set up an interview.
#Person1#: I think I'm going to go get some food.\n#Person2#: What do you want?\n#Person1#: I can't decide what to get.\n#Person2#: What kind of food do you want to get?\n#Person1#: I think I might like some Chinese food.\n#Person2#: Do you know where you're going to get it?\n#Person1#: I honestly don't know.\n#Person2#: I go to Panda Express for my Chinese food.\n#Person1#: You like the food there?\n#Person2#: I really like the food.\n#Person1#: I think I'll go and get my food there.\n#Person2#: I think you'll enjoy the food.
#Person1#: Tell me about the parking regulations on campus. I got fined yesterday.\n#Person2#: You have to get a parking permit first.\n#Person1#: Where can I get a permit?\n#Person2#: Over there in the Service Building. I can go with you... Right, here is the form you need... OK, surname, well I know that, Hanks... Other names, just Andrew. What's your student number?\n#Person1#: Oh, yes. It's 9301321.\n#Person2#: Your address.

OK, I can write the date, but you have to sign it yourself.\n#Person1#: Oh, OK, I can manage that I think.
#Person1#: Jim, thank goodness you've arrived. The class presentation started half an hour ago, and I was just beginning to panic.\n#Person2#: I'm sorry for being late, Alice. This morning has been a real mess, I didn't think I was going to make it here at all.\n#Person1#: Why are you late? Our presentation depends on those graphs you are holding.\n#Person2#: Yes, I know. I'll tell you about it later. First, let's see how we are doing for time. Two groups are still ahead of us, aren't they? The presentations on the rights of the consumer and the analysis of the stock market. That means I've got twenty minutes to sort out.\n#Person1#: You look cold. What happened?\n#Person2#: I've been standing outside in arctic temperatures for over an hour waiting for a bus.\n#Person1#: Over an hour. But I thought your apartment was only a ten minute bus ride to campus.\n#Person2#: In normal conditions, but the bus was delayed because of the weather, and when I stopped in a drug store to call home for a ride, the bus went by. As luck would have it there was no one at home, so I had to wait another forty-five minutes for the next bus.\n#Person1#: That's Murphy's Law, isn't it? What was it said? If anything can go wrong, it will. Well, we've still got twenty minutes to get our wits together.
#Person1#: Excuse me, but do you have the shirt in blue?\n#Person2#: Yes, we do. But only in small, large, and extra-large.\n#Person1#: Oh, dam. I was hoping to have it in a medium size. It would really go well with my bag.\n#Person2#: Well, we may be getting more in next week. Would you like me to check our computer?\n#Person1#: Oh, yes, please.\n#Person2#: OK. Yes,it looks like our manager has ordered more. We should have some in medium by next Thursday.\n#Person1#: Great! I'll ask my assistant to come back then and pick one up.
#Person1#: I've been worried that Richard is frozen.\n#Person2#: What sounds to be a problem?\n#Person1#: Well, he has trouble concentrating when getting along with other children. I was wondering there might be something on his mind. Some problem at home?
