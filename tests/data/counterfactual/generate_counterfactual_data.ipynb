Add white rice, black beans, and your choice of toppings like cheese, lettuce, and mild or medium salsa. Don't forget to include guacamole if you enjoy it.\\n\\n2. Bowl: Opt for a bowl instead of a burrito. Begin with a base of white or brown rice, then add your choice of protein, such as barbacoa or carnitas. Top it off with black beans, fajita vegetables, mild or medium salsa, and finish with a sprinkle of cheese and lettuce.\\n\\n3. Salad: For a lighter option, go for a salad. Start with a bed of lettuce and add your preferred protein, like grilled chicken or sofritas. Top it with black beans, pico de gallo, and choose a dressing of your choice, such as the Chipotle Honey Vinaigrette.\\n\\n4. Tacos: Select soft or crispy corn tortillas, and fill them with your choice of protein, such as barbacoa or grilled veggies. Add your preferred toppings such as cheese, sour cream, and guacamole.
