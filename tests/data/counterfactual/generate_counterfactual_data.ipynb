They may ask if you have a preferred order format (e.g., burrito, bowl, tacos).\\n4. Start by choosing your base, such as a burrito, bowl, or salad.\\n5. Next, select your protein. Popular options include grilled chicken, steak, barbacoa (shredded beef), carnitas (pulled pork), sofritas (tofu), or veggie options.\\n6. Move along to the rice and beans station. You can choose between cilantro-lime rice or brown rice, as well as pinto or black beans.\\n7. Proceed to the salsa station. There are typically a variety of salsas available, including mild, medium, and hot. They also have other options like corn salsa, guacamole, and sour cream.\\n8. Finally, you can add toppings such as lettuce, cheese, and any additional sauces or condiments.\\n9. After you've completed your order, the Chipotle employee will prepare it in front of you. They might ask if you want any additional sides or drinks.\\n10. Pay for your order at the cash register or use the Chipotle app for a contactless payment option.\\n11. Once your order is ready, you can take it to-go or find a seat if you plan to dine in.\\n\\nRemember, this process may vary slightly depending on the specific Chipotle location, but these steps should guide you through the ordering process.
